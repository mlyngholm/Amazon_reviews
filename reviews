319199,B000Y02VZI,A30GCXZ6TLGVSC,Smiley,1,1,5,1330214400,Awesome frosting !! Tastes like homemade !!,"I purchased three different brands of chocolate box frosting in order to do a taste test.  The three brands were: Pamela's Dark Chocolate Frosting, Cherrybrook Kitchen Chocolate Frosting, and Dr. Oetker Organic Chocolate Icing Mix.  Of the many people that tested the three in my family everyone preferred the Pamela's. I have often made my own frosting from scratch using these same exact ingredients and I must say that Pamela's tastes very close to my own scratch recipe.  It has more cocoa in it so it has a richer, fudgier flavor than the other two and absolutely NO odd flavors.  None of the three were bad but Pamela's was just better.  One drawback to the Cherrybrook Frosting is that it calls for 2 entire sticks of margarine or butter as opposed to pamela's 6 Tablespoons.  The Cherrybrook has a lighter chocolate but very buttery flavor.  A few of us thought Dr. Oetker's had a slightly odd taste but it was still pretty good. Pamela's is definitely our new favorite."

We tried Al Wadi but found it to find a strange after taste. Also tried the MIDEAST brand (not on Amazon) but found it to be bland. For a while we were able to purchase the excellent ""Prince Tahini"" online but now it is almost impossible to find in a reasonable price. This Tahini on the other hand is surprisingly good, reasonably priced and very close in taste to ""Prince Tahini"". The label indicates it is manufactured by ""Achdut"" in Israel which is the same factory that manufactures the ""Achva"" Tahini and Halva.  It arrived well packaged with no leaks or dents. Will definitely buy again."

141964,B003GTR8IO,A96AUNSF6GESO,Janeite,0,0,4,1290556800,Very Rich and Dark,"Every Starbucks coffee I've ever tried brews up so strong and dark that I always have to reduce the amount of coffee from what the directions recommend (usually by as much as half.) This flavorful, rich coffee is no different in that respect. First off, I must admit that I really don't care much for flavored coffees as I prefer actual coffee-flavored coffee. I also use a standard, automatic-drip machine (think Mr. Coffee), so I guess I'm not expert. But I do drink coffee daily and I love a good cup of rich, smooth coffee with a little real cream added. If you like your coffee VERY strong, brew this one according to package directions. I brewed it with half of the recommended amount and mixed in some Folger's decaf to round it out. You may be surprised to know that the result was a still-very-strong coffee (that some folks in my house wanted to dilute with water) that was smooth and tasty with just the right touch of vanilla. My husband drank it black and said it was ""fine"" but his only requirement of coffee is that it be strong, so this fit the bill. I added my usual cream and a distinctly unusual half-teaspoon of sugar. The result was a delicious, smooth, creamy coffee with a kick of sweet vanilla. Although I'm still no big fan of sweet or flavored coffee, I give this a big thumbs-up for taste. Since the holidays are approaching, I can see our family drinking this with dessert (or even as dessert after some turkey and dressing), and I also am considering picking up a few bags as holiday gifts. If you like Starbucks coffee this may be one you'd like to try."

I'll add my own 5 stars because they're an easy, convenient snack, and unlike Cheerios, they don't make a mess when the child is just learning to eat (the Cheerios were dribbling out of her mouth and onto her clothes); I suspect it's because the fruit puffs dissolve more quickly.  I'm not crazy about the price - 1.48 oz. isn't exactly a huge amount - but on the other hand, I don't give her that many, so a canister lasts a few weeks (vs. the recommended six servings).

It has a little bit of everything, thus the 100 calories. The milk is low fat, so it has a more light watery milk taste. The sugar is there (18g) but flavor-wise it loses to the coffee+cocoa taste, which dominates. Flavor wise, this is closer to the coffee/espresso/cocoa side than the sugar/cream side. I personally don't find it creamy enough to call it a mocha (maybe a very light mocha). My preferred serving is in a small but tall glass with oblong ice cubes so the water melts and ices more uniformly.<br /><br />It comes in a recycable coffee-color-coded can which opens up top like a soda can. The instructions say do not shake. One can is one serving, which is 8.45 fluid ounces, with 100 calories, 1.5g fat (1g saturated), 2% cholesterol, 3% sodium, 18g sugars, a little bit of fiber (under 1g), 4g protein, and 10% calcium.<br /><br />The caffeine is certainly there, 81mg in one can, it gives you a caffeine boost but it is not strong enough to turn you into Mad TV's Stan the Java man :)"

If you want to change to this -- just be aware that anytime you change your cat's food, you have to do so very gradually over about a week's time, mixing the new with the old in gradually increasing amounts. Never just switch from one food to another, or you are asking for stomach upsets. The people who make this food actually recommend feeding a mix of dry kibbles with the canned food, which is how I feed it. I have three Manx cats that I have switched over to this food and they are doing extremely well. Their coats have improved and they have more energy. One of my boys has lost weight on their low-calorie formula and he looks great. My female has stopped scratching herself and her fur has grown back where she licked it off -- I think she had food allergy issues with her old food. My other boy has issues with struvites and was on a prescription diet from the vet. However, the manufacturer even said he couldn't stay on it forever without constant blood testing because it could harm his kidneys! Who wants to feed their cat something that could harm his kidneys?? So far, after several months on Wellness, he's doing great. Their food keeps the Ph of the urine low, which is great for a cat with his problems. So many of the store bought foods are literally full of garbage -- rejected stuff that would be thrown away. Meat by-products contain some pretty horrible stuff. Also, cats are carnivores and need meat -- not cereal, which is a main ingredient in many cat foods. When's the last time you saw a cat in the wild eating corn or meal? Wellness has human grade meat as its main ingredient and also contains healthy veggies.  My two boys are on the Lite formula and my girl is on Adult Super5 Mix. I'm glad a friend told me about it. Highly recommended."

The lemongrass and lemon balm are things I already flavor some teas with and verbena is often even infused by itself.<br /><br />It says Premium Sencha Green Tea.  This was not the case in my box. It was average at best. Like any green tea it likes water that has cooled a bit after boiling (195F max). It gets the stereotypical bitter and 'burnt' flavors you get from using hotter water. It was not bad tea, just not even a mid end loose leaf Sencha you could get from a number of places.  The extra flavors cover this surprisingly well though.<br /><br />Two teabags had the slightly soapy taste you get when verbena is improperly handled. I sent a note to the company that it was noticed and they gave a very friendly ad rapid reply. I can only hope they learn from the errors as they go along.

I was pleased to read that they use no wheat gluten in their food, nor meat by-products; neither belongs in pet food.  They also make a point of saying that they use no products from China.  It's a reassurance I appreciate in the light of the recent spate of pet deaths linked to product coming out of China.<br /><br />What they do use was also reassuring.  White meat chicken, veggies, olive or soybean oils, vitamins and minerals.  The sesame chicken does contain rice which isn't something that should necessarily  be fed often, but it's a minor consideration.  While it's never said that the ingredients are ""human grade"" they are listed as safe for humans to eat.  I don't know about anyone else but I wouldn't want to feed my pets anything that wasn't safe for me to eat.<br /><br />The carton arrived and was marked as ""Product of Thailand"" which was a bit of a surprise since no mention of Thailand appears on their site.  They are, however, quick to point out that no child labor is used in production of any of the food.  (It's also listed as ""dolphin safe.""  This is a pretty politically correct company.)<br /><br />Of course the proof of the pudding, or in this case, the cat food, is the eating.  My response as I opened the cans was the the sesame chicken looked and smelled very tempting.  The chicken pot pie, not so much.  It smells wonderful, but is very watery.  Again, this is a minor consideration.  If my cat likes it, that's the important thing.  He's a picky boy, in part because he can't eat beef or lamb, so he's limited to poultry and certain types of fish.  He doesn't tend to like the souped-up, holistic foods that add things like rosemary and acai and all those things which humans so cheerfully add to their own foods.  But this stuff is pretty basic, and, well let's just say, he doesn't hate it.  I can probably add it to the rotation without causing much consternation, and know that he's getting a quality meal.<br /><br />Your mileage -- or your cat's -- may vary, of course.  Cats are perverse little beasts, and you just never know what they're going to take violent dislike to.  I can't tell you if your cat will like this food or not, but I can tell you that it looks like quality product made by people who have high standards.  Yes, it's pricey, but if you feel, as I do, that your cat deserves the consideration you'd give to any member of the family, you probably won't balk at the cost.<br /><br />The rest is up to your cat."

It came in a clear plastic bag with the pretty red label.  Very colorful corn - lots of dark red with a few kernels of white mixed in.  As some of the other reviewers have said, for a hot air popper, you'll definitely want to tip the popper backward the minute you plug it in or else the air pressure will send kernels flying around your kitchen like schrapnel.  Trust me - you'll be ducking for cover and then finding kernels for the next year or so.  I did not let go of my hot air popper until there was a good amount of popped corn to weigh down the unpopped kernels.  These kernels are noticeably smaller than others you'll see in the grocery store so when they pop, the end result is smaller.  If you have shag carpet, this is probably not a good thing.  The husks are softer and tend to cause less damage to your gums if they get caughtin your teeth, though it won't happen often.  The cost for this little bag is also significantly higher than we'd want to pay again.  Another big con for us is the number of unpopped kernels that remain - probably 1 - 2 dozen per 1/2 cup batch.

Yes, this was even after I told him about my pup. He said he's got a big dog too who's a ""chewer."" Kobe usually knows when I've bought him something. Soon as I got home, I had to test it out. After 10 mins, not a dent so I was pretty amazed so far. 20 mins later, I see he managed to get that treat out!?!? Sigh...so I pried it out of his mouth and put that slobbery thing back in the ball. Next thing, he had it out again and this time he chewed a good chunk of it so it no longer fit. So I put it in the inner part of the ball and minutes later he got it out of there too. S-I-G-H.<br />I take off 1 star because in my case it was everlasting. I do give it credit for being pretty durable and the treat took a little while longer for him to eat.

Maltitol is an alcohol sugar and can be undigestible in the body.  You will know a short time after consuming it if you are one of the unsuspecting many who cannot digest it by the extreme intestinal bloating and cramping and massive amounts of gas a person can experience. Nausea, diarrhea & headaches can also be experienced. I learned my lesson the hard way years ago when I fell in love with the sugar-free chocolates suzanne sommers used to sell.  I thought I'd found sugar-free chocolate nirvana at first taste but the bliss was short lived when the terrible side effects of maltitol kicked in.  The discomfort was unlike anything I had ever felt before.  I blew up like a balloon and had very painful abdominal cramping.  As the symptoms passed, this too was very unpleasant.  Though hard for me to believe a low calorie sweetener could be the culprit, all symptoms were gone when I stopped eating the chocolate. My hunch it had something to do with the maltitol were unfortunately confirmed for me about a year later when I purchased some delicious sugar-free popcorn at my local market.  The taste was amazing and while I was looking at the label wondering what could possibly make this yummy, new sugarfree treat taste so good, my heart sank when I followed the little asterisk next to sugarfree sweetener* down to the very bottom of the label and read ""maltitol"" in tiny little letters! Thank goodness I'd eaten only a little. I still ended up with all the same side-effects but for a much shorter duration. Some people can use maltitol to their heart's content but others, like me, can have a bad reaction to it. In case you're like me, ... it's not you ...it's the maltitol!"

To be honest, there is no gluten free product on the market that will ever compare to the moistness of white bread, but it is a wonderful substitute and toasts up great and makes wonderful bread crumbs.  With Vegenaise brand mayo, I get to enjoy the awesomeness of a tuna fish sandwich that the rest of the world takes for granted.  My mom smiles with pleasure and giggles along with me when I say ""I get to eat like real people!""  Trust me, at 50 years old, eating like real people is a dream come true."

I tried to find it in the bricks and mortar stores, and they don't seem to have it or even know what I am talking about.  I even checked the bulk candy place in the mall (which seems to have gotten very expensive), yet even they didn't seem to know.<br /><br />Nitwitz works well as a ""candy dish"" candy because the pieces are solid (no candy dust) and don't seem to leave a residue in the dish (like a gummy candy might).  These are very similar to Willy Wonka Runts, but somewhat smaller and more tart.  The only issue with it is that it seems that the oranges make up an outsize percentage of the mix.  I suppose that it is possible that buying it from the machine somehow filtered out the larger orange pieces.  Also, the orange pieces are more like jawbreakers and I will have to warn guests about trying to bite down on them right away.  The other pieces are not quite as hard.<br /><br />Overall, I am pleased with the 2.5 lbs. mix and it should last me for several months.  It arrived in an unlabeled, sealed plastic bag inside two padded envelopes.  There does not seem to be any broken pieces."

Using the smaller bits costs less and takes up less storage room over the larger size porcini pieces available from this vendor.

I sometimes add a few black trumpet mushrooms for visual presentation.  JR has great Black Trumpets too.<br /><br />JR Porcini Kibbles are very high quality and are just the right size.  So to use them just soak them in hot water for about half an hour, no additional chopping needed.

I definitely recommend boycotting major media and getting your news from alternative sources like ENENews which covers what university professors and doctors say is the real truth.

I learned awhile back that supplements, superfoods, herbs etc. must be taken consistently in order to experience results.I began taking maca for its<br />nutrition and reputed adaptogenic effects (similar to ginseng). I later learned through research that it is a food and does not need to be taken in small amounts.Since I was a part time softball player after work and trying to increase my fitness, I also increased maca intake. Oatmeal, smoothies, soup, beverages. I had maca at least twice a day in 1-2 ounce portions. I also want to add I was not on caffeine at this time- I valued my sleep. It took about 2 and a half weeks to notice a marked improvement in energy and mood.This experiment 3 years ago convinced me that maca works for me and I haven't been without it for long since.<br />  Do try this in small amounts first. The taste is not bad,but malty and a bittersweet, like dong quai.You will pay quite a bit more for small packaging and/or gelatin capsules, but it will be worth it if you can reap the benefits.Then go for the big bag and never let go of your health."

This is another of the pasta mixes they currently offer and clearly these are designed to compete with the Hamburger Helper brand that you add meat, water and sometimes butter to as well.  Since this is a competitor, it makes sense to compare them.<br /><br />Frankly this Velveeta version of the Cheeseburger variety falls far short of the Hamburger Helper version.  The steps are almost identical except for the added foil packet of Velveeta sauce that you add at the end.  I'm not sure what caused the sour taste that no one in the family liked, but since we have liked the plain boxed pastas versions before, I'm thinking it must be the seasonings packet.  Not only did this not stand up to the level of Hamburger Helper but it also fell short of the store brand of this particular variety which we've also had several times, thus the 2 instead of 3 stars I would have given it had it pleased my family as much as s the store brand.<br /><br />The final result is that the product is OK but certainly not as good a taste as other brands of this exact same variety. Since these box mixes tend to cost more than either Hamburger Helper or store brands, the value is even less.  You'd do better just adding your own ingredients to pasta and cheese you had around the house."

Also unfortunately, while the box says it holds ""single serve pods"" it does not specify that they're pods for a machine, or in fact what machines they work with.  The packets themselves say nothing at all about pods or machines.<br /><br />So here's the problem: I have a box of single serve coffee pods which don't really tell me much of anything, requested because I thought they were simply single-serve coffee bags, not unlike tea bags.  And I don't own a pod coffee maker.  I don't like them very much.  I'm going to have to improvise in order to do any sort of review.<br /><br />I tossed a couple of pods into my standard drip coffee maker and added two cups of water (The classic 6 oz cup by which coffee is still measured in spite of the fact that we now live in a world where 16 oz cups are considered small.) What I got back out was a brew that would make church coffee laugh derisively. So then I just threw two bags into a cup and added 12 oz of hot water, and let them steep until the brew looked darker, and that actually worked pretty well.  With due respect to the gentleman who said ""teabagging"" with these things doesn't work, I have to disagree.  It makes a decent enough cup.  The coffee isn't strong, but it is smooth, and has has the classic African warmth and brightness.<br /><br />In all fairness, the truest test of this coffee would be to use it in a pod-style coffee maker, but absent that, you can actually make a decent cup without much work.  Just remember that it's 1 pod to each 6 oz of water, no matter what the instructions say.<br /><br />Which brings me to a gripe.  Where the heck are people finding instructions?  There are none on the box, none on the individual packets.  The only instruction I found was on the pod itself.  One side says: ""This side down""  Seriously, even if your product is for a machine, it's a good idea to be clear about how to use the product in that machine.<br /><br />All in all, Marley Coffee got points for flavor but lost them for unnecessarily vague packaging and the fact that it's kind of pricey.  I don't honestly think that I'd change my review substantially even if I had a pod-style coffee maker to test it with, however if I do manage to find one and it changes my opinion, I will absolutely update this review.<br /><br />Amazon, you need to give a bit more information in your descriptions for Vine reviewers.  At least to the point where you let us know if any special equipment is required to use a product."

My dog heard the package rustling though and immediately ran over to see what I had.

I haven't had much luck testing out pet products on her, as she is so picky. (You wouldn't think a mutt who ate trash for months as a stray would be this picky but she is) She decided though that she wanted this treat: she snapped it out of my hand and ran behind the couch to eat it, so that no one could even *think* of taking it from her. Normally she just takes her favorite treat a few feet away from me, so the fact that she ran and hid to eat this means a lot.<br /><br />My elderly (15 year old) cat even showed an interest in these, which is not normal for her in the least.

482344,B0018KLPFK,A1V1LLQUE8A2NR,Pen Pal,39,151,1,1159401600,"""Health"" Does Not Always Equal Health","It took me a decade of yo-yo dieting on various plans, four short-term successes, and now, hopefully, a long-term success is on the way. I have lost 35 lbs in 6 months, and going strong. I lost it gradually and within recommended weight loss recommendations (1-2 lbs a week). I didn't starve myself, stop my social life for any diet's decrees, and I definitely wasn't under the tutelage of any one diet. I have done that already and realize a few things: 1) you must exercise daily, 2) you must mind calories, 3) you must eat 3 meals and 2 snacks every day, and 4) the types of nutrients matter (omega 3, 6, and 9 fats, thermogenic herbs, antioxidants, etc.)<br /><br />The greatest myth I busted was any form of perfectionism. If you have a candy bar once in a while, that doesn't mean you are a big failure, you have to start all over, and you might as well do that next week (so you can binge in the meantime).<br /><br />All diets are perfectionistic. They focus on one aspect of healthy eating and run with it to fit the lose-weight-overnight / Can-I-also-have-a-pizza-with-all-the-fixings? mentality of the typical deluded American. That's why we have the Atkins diet, illustrating the worst of this concept. However, these diets aren't bad, because you can extract a jewel of knowledge from each of these regimens. Atkins taught us to watch carbs and not to fear protein (although that doesn't mean you can eat bacon); Fat Flush teaches you the difference between good and bad fats, thermogenic herbs (that raise the metabolism), and a very basic understanding of the Glycemic Index, and Thurmond teaches you what combinations of foods work to lose weight and the power of eating many small meals throughout the day.<br /><br />Larabar is another great example of the focused diet. The jewel is the omega fats 3 and 6, gluten-free, no dietary sweeteners (which increase your appetite and studies have correlated artificial sweeteners to weight gain because of its high glycemic index count), and it being all natural, organic, and kosher. That's great, when you focus on only this aspect. But still, however popular diets have become, Weight Watchers, Jenny Craig, and the like can never be ignored. The one irrefutable truth is the calories you take in determine what your weight will be in the immediate future. If there is a high fat percentage, which are calories still, you have to consider that.<br /><br />LARABARS HAVE 45 - 55 % FAT! 200 + CALORIES! These health bars are healthy, but I would only have them as a reward before or after a good workout. This is the first review that I am rating this low because of the padding I suspect going on. One reviewer talks about the low calories, which is totally false. Two reviewers talk about how healthy it is, sounding very close to an infomercial as he focuses on only one aspect but ignores another. The suspicion arises when these two reviewers rate this bar 5 STARS 3-4 FREAKIN' TIMES WITH THE SAME WORDS! They must mention the excessive calories and fat in these bars, or else someone's going to go off of insufficient information and eat one every day with a sedentary lifestyle. Compare this bar to a Snickers, and you may have a different perspective. What is labeled ""healthy"" can be very bias.<br /><br />MY POINT BEYOND LARABARS: You can't focus on one system of ideas, because health and nutrition and weight loss are much larger and much more demanding concepts of nature's effect on the body. It's how you sustain and develop habits and balance in life, and it's about the knowledge you keep in your head, so you can deftly cut corners through increasing your metabolism or burning the maximum calories. It's about myth busting. It's about making smart choices. It's about knowing what choices are in the first place; if you choose one path, you can't choose another. Sacrifices may be what your particular body requires to be healthy and lose weight. You won't find a real chili-dog diet. You won't find a sugar that tastes exactly like sugar. One path leads to one place, while the other path leads to another. Note the difference, and be realistic.<br /><br />Lastly, the only health change you can make overnight happens in your head, not in your body."

Personally, I would prefer the floral essences to be more pronounced, but I understand the need to appeal to a broad range of palates. I see some reviews have mentioned a putrid or medicinal smell/taste to this tea: what they're smelling and tasting is the valerian root. Valerian has an unmistakable odor; once you smell it you'll never forget it. I'd say to go to a health food store and sniff a bottle of pure valerian capsules to familiarize yourself with the odor, but it might ruin the tea for you. Its presence in this tea is noticeable, but not overpowering. The valerian scent is strongest when you first open the packet; the smell of the brewed tea leans more towards the rose, geranium, and citrus side of the spectrum. The licorice in the tea doesn't impart much in the way of overt flavor, but does make itself known with an ever-so-slight cooling aftertaste."

226794,B006BXV1H6,A3RU2P4FAACQ1J,"Elton Pinto ""Eptiger""",0,0,3,1334966400,"Decent cereal, but not a home run","I consider myself a bit of a cereal connoisseur - I have over a dozen boxes of cereal in my cupboard as I like eating different cereal every weekday morning (I have something different on weekends) so you can imagine that I'm a big fan of the stuff. There are four main dimensions that I think cereal should be judged on: nutritional value, taste, ability to satiate your appetite, and staying power.<br /><br />Nutritionally, this cereal is comparable to most other mainstream GM/Kellogg cereals. Similar balance of vitamins, not too high in fat, sugary but not moreso than any other cereal, low in protein. If you're looking for something high in nutrition, look to Puffins or Kashi or Bob's Red Mill or something.<br /><br />Taste-wise, it's pretty good but not as good as I was expecting. I was hoping for something like that Trader Joe's cereal that was whole grain squares enveloping hazelnut chocolate - while it used hazelnut chocolate instead it was a perfect balance of sweetness. This Krave cereal, as you can imagine, is a bit on the sweet side. I have a sweet tooth and even I felt it was rather sweet, but not as sweet as cereals with marshmellows in them. Close, but not quite that much - so to me, it's not too overpowering, but not something I can have every day because of how sweet it is. The chocolatey flavor is much more like chocolate than cereals like Cocoa Puffs or Cocoa Pebbles (or most other chocolate laden cereals), but it does leave a bit of a sandy taste in your mouth and can collect on your teeth if you don't gargle afterward.<br /><br />When it comes to satiation, this cereal scores pretty low. Usually I have two cereals in the morning: a bowl of something good for me and half a bowl of something tasty but not as nutritional. When I compared Krave to some other cereals (Wheaties Fuel, Puffins chocolate puffs, Honey Bunches of Oats, the Kashi cinnamon bunches cereal), I felt hungry pretty soon afterwards. I expect cereal to hold me over for at least 2 hours, but this cereal did not do that.<br /><br />Staying power wise, I have to admit that this cereal performs well. Staying power means that I've noticed that often times you can get tired of a cereal pretty quickly and not want to eat it again. At some point, this happens with all cereals you eat too much of, but I've been eating this stuff at a normal pace for over a month now and I still keep coming back to it. It's not good enough that I want it all the time, but once a week I do kind of crave it a bit so the cereal name appears apt.<br /><br />With my highly unscientific method, I'll give it 3 stars since, as a whole, I think it's fairly mediocre but still a respectable cereal to take home with you."

For the convenience of buying this and having it last a long time and not making one myself, I think this bag is definitely worth the investment.

We made the mistake of not mixing everything together (oil, popcorn, and buttery salt).  That was our fault because we didn't read the instructions due to excitement.  But our first batch was still very good (a little salty because we added the salt mix last).  We made another batch two days later and it was awesome.  This is as close to theater popcorn made in our house ever.  It was really, really good.  Every kernell popped and it was a perfect balance.  We will NEVER, and I mean NEVER buy microwave or store popcorn again....We will be placing another order very soon.  I almost forgot to mention that we bought the 8oz bags.

It's heartening that there's a healthy alternative to prescription drugs, Midol, and birth control pills.

You really have nothing to lose except your PMS symptoms, by trying this tea. I believe you can even order this by the box, if you don't want to buy the case.

It's not perfect, but it's the best alternative on the market for people concerned about what they put in their bodies.  It's a good start, but hopefully the company will focus on producing a product whose flavor lasts longer and which stays soft longer.

So I looked around the house for something I can mix this with, and then it hit me, oatmeal.  I had some McCann's steel cut oatmeal.  I mixed 1 and half cup of dry oatmeal, cooked it first for around half an hour.  When it's ready, I threw in the pudding.  The result was FANTASTIC, it was not overly sweet and had plenty of flavor, not to mention, the pudding just got 10 times healthier because the oatmeal is high fiber and low calories.  Perfect for breakfast.<br /><br />In addition to oatmeal, I can think of several other things that you might consider mixing this pudding with.  Cake mix (then bake the cake, of course), rice congee (add a variety of beans for even more flavor), and pumpkin pie.  Just be creative and dont eat this by itself, the flavor would so sweet and rich that it would make you sick.

Initially, our dog was a little slow in understanding the concept and wasn't very interested in it.  But after a few days, he got the idea and now gets excited whenever he sees us filling it up.  We usually fill the container with a mix of his kibble and some cut up treats for a total of about a 1/4 of a cup and it keeps him occupied for about 30-45 minutes at a time.  We haven't tried adding balls to the jug yet to increase the difficulty, but we may do so soon.<br /><br />This toy has been a savior to help occupy him while we are busy trying to do things around the house, such as cook dinner or do laundry.  I also give it to him to prevent boredom as well as help get rid of some excess energy that he still may have at night since he will push, drag, and carry it all over the place as he is trying to get out the contents.  After a month of use, the only thing that has some signs of wear and tear is the rope.  Our puppy hasn't done any damage to the actual jug yet.<br /><br />On a side note, I have seen the smaller ones in the store that have rubber/plastic ropes, which do not seem to be very durable, but ours was an actual rope, as in the picture and has held up great with our dog.

Because we don't drink many sweet beverages, the 70 calories and 17 sugar grams seemed outrageous.  We also were not thrilled with the biblical proverbs imprinted on the packaging.  After opening the first pouch, however, our family was hooked on the spicy sweet crystals.  Each pouch contains 12 grams of ginger and it is very, very spicy, just what we like around here.  We empty a packet into a little jar and always have some accessible in the kitchen.  I use a little binder clip on a packet in my bag when traveling, so I can slip a few crystals on my tongue even when there's no water available.  I add this to white or green tea, mix it in my chai and add no other sweetener, sprinkle it on yogurt, fruit and fiber cereal in the morning, and even have used it to tone down an overly spicy seafood stew I made last week.  I don't know how, but throwing in about a half teaspoon worked a miracle.  The hot beverage is great when we're nauseous or just feeling less than perfect, and when chilled, is a perfect complement to one of those clear beverages we may drink for relaxation.

I ordered this because I did not want wakame from the NE Japanese coast where, before the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the world's best macrobiotic quality wakame was harvested.<br /><br />I spoke with Great Eastern Sun who has the Emerald Cove brand.  They assured me that this wakame is 1st quality and that they have tested for heavy metals and pollutants, as it comes from a large bay off the coast of north-eastern China.  The tiny bits swelled up to perfect bite-size pieces after putting them in boiling water.<br /><br />In addition to grabbing heavy metals in the body, wakame prevents hyaluronic acid in the skin from breaking down so fast.  This acid keeps skin youthful."

Definitely recommend this to anyone looking to feed their cats a great diet, but don't have the time or money to feed raw."

However, spot checking the ingredients shows that most of them (Calcium Pantothenate or Pyridoxine Hydrochloride for example) were just vitamin supplements; a few were harder to decipher, though (Sodium Hexametaphosphate?)  The most common ingredient is wheat, so if your dog has a wheat allergy, avoid these.<br /><br />As to taste, I refrained from trying them myself, but it did seem a bit dryer and more powdery than other treats I feed him; he didn't seem as wildly enthusiastic about them as he is about his organic kibble, but he sure ate every speck, and started noticing when I got the box out. (To be fair, he'd probably eat bark if I put it in a bowl with some kibble and water).<br /><br />Overall, these are probably a good option if you want to do something for your dog's teeth; they're certainly far cheaper than the other dog dental treats I've seen for sale.

Over the years we have tried them all and found each product wanting - until we found Ideal.<br /><br />This sweetener has the taste and texture of sugar without any of the issues surrounding other sugar substitutes. It avoids the question of health risks attributed to aspartame. It does not have the 'grassy' taste of Stevia; the 'cold' sensation of erythritol; or, what we find to be, the after-taste of Splenda.<br /><br />For baking, it is unparalleled. Even our friends who eat sugar cannot tell that we use Ideal. We bake custards and crustless cheesecakes with Ideal and no one knows that they are sugar free. We use it in confections such as fudge and chocolate truffles with exceptional results.<br /><br />Like many other sugar alternatives, Ideal will not caramelize. This is not a fault of the product but rather a chemical dynamic of sugar alcohol based sweeteners. However, this seems is a small price to pay for a sweetener that is otherwise indistinguishable from sugar.<br /><br />Whether you choose to use the brown sugar substitute (which does not have the actual sugar found in Splenda's brown sugar blend) or the white sweetener, we are sure that you will find Ideal a wonderful alternative to sugar. We recommend it to our friends who are diabetic or who are looking to cut out sugar for other reasons. They all agree that it is the best tasting alternative to sugar on the market today."

Now, after conglomerate Coca Cola bought them, it's dumbed down: it's now part coconut water (juice) watered down with H2O (water) with unspecified ""natural flavor"" added so you are tricked into thinking your coconut water hasn't just been seriously diluted. Why?  It's cheaper!  They save money by cutting it with plain water.  But it wouldn't taste the same, right?  That's where the flavoring comes in.... To trick you.<br /><br />Zico wont actually specify how much they water it down but you can guesstimate simply by their ads.... They brag this product has 30% less sugar than other brands.  Ok, that means this is likely a 70% coconut to 30% water mixture.  Do you want 100% coconut water or 70% coconut water in your bottle?<br /><br />This isn't the ratio nature intended by the way.

We tried the Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (Yellowfin, Snapper, Tuna & Sole, Tuna & Shrimp) and the Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (Chinese Chicken & Chicken Pot Pie) over the course of sixteen days. Each cat got about one-quarter can each day.  I alternated cans of chicken and fish varieties.<br /><br />At first, the felines were enthusiastic.  After a while they tired of the chicken.  Pi would only lick up the gravy, while Brownie refused to even look at it.  The fish was better received.  They like the yellowfin and the tuna & shrimp.  The cat vote is for two of the six varieties.<br /><br />There is, however, a question of mercury in ocean fish.

The study and its results are discussed in an article that you can find on the web by using the search term ""all about tuna fish"".

This is the type of chocolate that is as good for your heart as red wine. And it definitely does not hurt your feelings to eat it!

Since we've been doing the 17-day diet, this makes it bearable as well as adding the anti-oxidant and flavonoids that are important to health.

169492,B006NSO5TA,A1RQQ2HWUGEUWA,EB MamaBear,3,3,1,1323820800,"NOT what I originally ordered! BOO, amazon!","As another reviewer stated, many of the reviews for this product are actually for a DIFFERENT raw cacao powder- from alive and aware, ecuadorian criollo raw cacao powder. That is what I ordered about 3 months ago and it was AWESOME! I am almost out and when I went to reorder my amazon account directed me to this product, from SAQUIN??, which is NOT what I ordered, and it is more expensive- the same base price but i got it with FREE shipping, not 15 bucks so that is a big price increase.  I know it was still from alive and aware mid-february, but recently something changed.<br />I am really confused/irritated how my review for ""alive and aware raw cacao"" got switched to a different brand from a different seller?!?! i mean, can't they just say ""out of stock"" or ""currently unavailable"" like they do with other stuff. why would they switch reviews around?<br />Seems very underhanded to transfer reviews from a different product to a newer one, especially since as the other reviewer stated they are NOT comparable and this stuff from SAQUIN is terrible compared to what we were getting from alive and aware. also the price increase is pretty shocking! i guess it is the market, and raw cacao is in higher demand. Too bad that was such an awesome price for really awesome cacao.<br />I did recently order alive and aware's raw criollo cacao nibs and i highly recommend those. they are as the description states, from alive and aware, not another brand.<br />Frankly I am beginning to wonder about some of the ""brands"" and ""vendors"" that ship from Amazon. I know they have warehouses in different parts of the country, but it is a little suspicious and I just wish there was more transparency about what comes from Amazon and what comes from a different company. seems like halal everyday, alive and aware, etc, are almost interchangable since amazon took the liberty to take reviews from alive and aware and post them to halaleveryday/saquin. are these really different companies, under the auspices of amazon, or is it amazon by a different name only? like the other reviewer said, he ordered something that said ""alive and aware"" in the description and when it came it was from saquin/halal everyday.  who knows. i just want some more transparency so i can have more trust when ordering from amazon.<br /><br />For now, i am going to seek out another source, not through amazon, that stands behind their cacao. it is very important to me, for health benefits and the ecological/social impacts of where it is harvested, to know that i am getting top-notch, certified organic, raw cacao. if amazon is going to be so wishy-washy and sneaky, I'm going elsewhere. (wagging finger at amazon!)<br /><br />I think for now I will leave the following review for alive and aware in case they do bring it back.<br /><br />Heavens to Besty, this stuff ROCKS!! It is such a good value too, maybe the best out there as I have def shopped around.  I have tried a few different brands of raw organic cacao powder, and this is certainly top-notch.  Kudos to Alive and Aware for offering it at such a reasonable price!!<br />I am not a raw foodie per say, but I try to follow a neo-paleo protocol which includes super foods such as raw cacao.  Properly prepared, with just enough natural sweetener, I think this is a truly guilt-free pleasure.  It is LOADED with antioxidants, as you probably know.  So go ahead, get the big bag.  You can then share it with friends and family and turn them on to this super groovy super food ""of the Gods"" (theobroma) as they say :)<br />My favorite way to consume it is actually as not so hot cocoa- I just whisk it into gently heated fresh (raw) whole milk or cream (so it's not too hot and to preserve as much nutrients as possible, I know it's not 100% raw  but hey this is how I love it!), add just enough sweetener (I like sorghum molasses, a scant t-spoon), a bit of maca powder, a dash of real salt, and after that's thoroughly whisked I top it off with a spoonful of EVO COCONUT OIL- YUMM!!! I have converted everyone, even the kids I babysit (who used to prefer swiss miss). Or I make a concentrated warm cocoa beverage sans maca and coconut oil and then stir it into my raw milk for a half gallon of raw chocolate milk, lightly sweetened.  You better believe it goes fast!!  I love my family to get their good old fashioned grass fed animal fats with bioavailable vitamins A, D and the X- factor (read Weston A Price) and loads of antioxidants from the cacao to boot.  Plus cacao activates the seratonin receptors and sorry I am bit fuzzy but you know it makes you feel good and happy!!<br />Also process it with EVO Coconut Oil and sweetener such as sorghum or honey or maple syrup in your cuisinart for heavenly truffles- refrigerate for proper texture due to coconut oil.  I often toss in soaked,dried nuts and dried unsulfured fruit and shredded coconut for healthy truffle energy bars. just process in batches so it's kind of homogenous. Like those lara bars but cheaper and no packaging and even organic or raw.<br />Go for it! Buy this huge bag, share the goodness and you'll be healthier and happier for it. I guarantee!!

I have tried several of their flavors and all have been good.  The Sweet & Hot could be a little hotter, IMO, but it is still awesome and my favorite of theirs.  Besides the different flavors being good, what really sets Jack Link's apart from every other jerky I've tried is the quality of the meat itself.  The meat has the perfect amount of moisture, making it able to actually bite a piece in half without having to gnaw on it for 20 minutes.  While other brands aren't very consistent, particularly Pemmican, which I used to think was the best available, Jack Link's is very consistent with the quality of each piece.  Most brands usually have a mix of perfect pieces, dry pieces, and way too thick pieces.  Not Jack Link's, I've yet to get a dry piece, or one that was way too thick.<br /><br />The several people that I have ""turned on to"" Jack Link's would fully agree with me about this review.  We've actually spoke about how amazed we are with it.<br /><br />Walmart is the place that I first found it, and they are always out of stock of it.  So I turned to Amazon and was able to find it for roughly the same price when you factor in shipping.<br /><br />BTW, the package of ten 1.5 ounce bags is nice if you are like me and tend to just keep eating until it is gone.  :)  Also, each 1.5 ounce bag has about 25 grams of protein.  So if you are on a workout program, it makes a nice way to get extra 25 grams of protein with very little fat into your diet."

I don't even taste it. Even tho I'm an advanced chili pepper user, I have a very keen palate. I detect less than 1 part per billion of chili in these here unfortunate chips.<br /><br />Also, I detect fraudulent lime flavors and *that* my friends is an egregious error from such a reknowned company. The red herring that it's NOT natural is ""NATURAL FLAVORS WITH LIME"". The translation here is that these natural flavors could be really anything, could be any combination of terpene extracts from 'natural sources'. For example, fake lemon flavor in candies and wood detergent is often an extract from lemongrass because it's cheaper than from lemons. But it's a different chemical also. Fake lime is immediately a mistake, and anyone-not just supertasters-can tell.<br /><br />This fakeLime taste, or 'floor detergent flavor', is reminiscent of a childhood fragrance- the strong chemical citrus waft of mopwater that a theater employee was using to mask the rotting popcorn-soda-slurry smell by the dumpster.<br /><br />In other words, it seems as if Garden of Eatin found the cheapest, strongest floor stripping chemicals from Big Lots, extracted the lime scent component and littered it lightly onto these chips.<br /><br />So if you want to mop floor with a tea of these, or you are considering a colon cleanse, accept no substitute.<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------<br />Ok so along the lines of constructive criticism:<br /><br />ATTN: Garden of EATIN'<br /><br />Please contact Tostitos sensory labs scientists. It is imperative that you find out how Tostitos makes their hint of lime chips because they got it right. Use at least 500 ppm nanolimeparticles and same same for chili.

The bowl shape was a little awkward to hold.<br /><br />Preparation: The instructions seemed a little more elaborate than what is probably necessary. The one problem I had was that since I don't have a measuring cup with me at work (who does?) I had to estimate how much water to put in; I filled up to the line at the top of the bowl which I don't think was there for that purpose. Would have been nice if they had just marked the fill line on the side of the bowl. I think I put too much because the soup was barely hot after heating for the indicated ninety seconds.<br /><br />Ingredients: Indicating that it contains tofu is a little disingenuous; mine only had two pieces of tofu and one was half-sized. There were a lot of noodles. Too many noodles really. There weren't enough leafy veggies; mostly the scallions. The ingredients themselves seemed to be fresh and quality though.<br /><br />Taste: So very very bland. Just...amazingly bland. The over-abundance of bland completely tasteless noodles seemed like the main culprit. The only flavor besides bland noodles was scallions. I felt like I was eating scallion noodle water. I kind of feel sick now; there's a lump of oniony noodles just sitting in my stomach. In fact I'm contemplating running out on my break to buy something else just to get the taste out of my mouth...<br /><br />Over all I would rate this item pretty poorly.

They were the favorites of the house then, and they are the favorites now.  I can't ever keep a box of these guys around very long - they just disappear without warning!

In the future I plan to get the yard done over with concrete and bricks where I don't have to deal with nature on that level, but I don't have the funds right now to begin the process. Until then I searched online to try to find something that will give these weeds a knockout punch! Well this is it! I ordered 2 bottles, had my son spray liberally in the back and front yard and I waited for results.  To my amazement this stuff really works. My son applied 2 applications and around the 2nd or 3rd day 95% of the front yard was an ugly shriveled up yellow.

The Shiloh Shepherd is considered a 'giant breed.'  With his enormous size, athleticism, and the general nutrient demands, we all must consider, his diet has always been a primary consideration.  Not to mention, he has the sensitive tummy often seen among the German Shepherd breed.  His breeder has always been partial to 'Premium Edge Lamb.'  This is the formula he was weaned on.  I had no desire to change what appeared to be a successful regimen.<br /><br />Then to my dismay, I learned 'Premium Edge' was placed on a recent recall list.  I knew that a change in diet was likely to be detrimental to my fur friend, but I had to take immediate action.  And, at the time of recall, I didn't have time to gradually transition to a new diet, which is always the way to go, to avoid negative symptoms.<br /><br />After carefully analyzing formulas of numerous dry kibble, I opted to give Pinnacle (Trout & Sweet Potato) a try, ordering a 15 pound 'starter' bag from Amazon.  In addition, I ordered some digestive enzymes to assist in the transition phase.<br /><br />The bag arrived.  I opened it with my dog assisting to see what his response would be.  The first whiff out of the bag was strong, smelling of fish.  I noted the kibble size, itself, was quite small for a large breed dog, but felt this was only a minor reservation.  The ultimate test was not what I thought about it, but what my Shiloh would.  He immediately had a positive response.  In fact --- he loves it!  He appears more enthusiastic about it than the 'Premium Edge.'<br /><br />I had to start the Pinnacle before the enzymes arrived, so I was expecting some terrible gas and possibly some diarrhea.  Well, that was not the case.  He has gone through the 15 pound bag, and half of the next order --- a 30 pound bag, with no diarrhea, or gas, at all.  In fact, his stools appear firmer and more consistent than on his previous diet.  Supplementing with the enzymes was actually not necessary.<br /><br />I'm delighted with this new regimen.  I also love that I can order a 30 pound bag through Amazon and have it delivered to my front door.  I'm now avoiding a considerable drive,  and,  the back-breaking-discomfort, of lugging around heavy bags of kibble.<br /><br />My dog is happy, and I'm happy.

It turned out that this kibble is good--high protein source (even slightly higher than Blue Buffalo), good size (medium), smells delicious, but just too smoky. The color of the kibble is pretty dark, I guess it's overcooked. My dog, a Belgium Malinois, still likes it. But she loves Orijen better. Over the past year, we have tried many brands such as: Blue Buffalo, NutroMax, Purina (Beef), Taste of the Wild, Canidae, and Orijen. By far, Orijen seems to be the best. Second being Blue Buffalo--but I am suspecting that my dog is allergic to the ingredients in it--she has bad dandruff and dried skin. So I decided to try Nutromax and Purina--both are pretty decent good kibbles (based on the price). Canidae is almost as good as Blue Buffalo. I will see after I am feeding her with Taste and Orijen mix would help her skin and coat. Hopefully it works. We've tried so many things you can name: fish oil (the real one, not the pills), weekly grooming with application of moisturizer spray specially designed for dogs, real meat, and skin tablets. Will update about this later on. The only thing my dad doesn't like Taste of the Wild is that it's too smoky--almost plungent, not sure if it's healthy. Therefore, 4 star! btw, all the above mentioned kibbles except Purina and Nutromax are natural and grain free.<br /><br />Base on what I learned from my experienced German Shepherd Trainer, the following are good kibbles:<br /><br />1.

As my body worked to push it out, I developed a tumor that needed to be surgically removed.  To say I have a broken glass phobia is an understatement.  I also through the entire shipment away instead of digging through the glop to find my unbroken jars, but these are tough economic times, and a baby's got to eat.

Mmmm!)<br /><br />Unlike some of Stash's teas, this is also perfect iced or at room-temperature, with no filmy crust of flavoring and tea dust to form on top.  If you have ever liked a honeybush tea, I am confident you will like this one.  The flavor is also similar to rooibos, if you've tried that, but rooibos has a wider range of flavors it can adopt than honeybush does.  Honeybush is always, as its name suggests, just a bit warm and sweet."

He has also been drinking insane amounts of water, and ran outside to eat lots of grass as fast as possible, which is uncharacteristic of him. He has stopped throwing up, but I suspect it is because he either has nothing left to puke, or is fighting it off as his diaphram is still jumping. He wont even lie in bed, which is where he lives.

It turns out that her problem was in fact due to corn and other fillers used in lesser quality dog foods (in this case, Purina One). Overall, this product alone made it completely worth the cost to subscribe to Amazon Prime for the extremely fast and cheap shipping, so for less money (as Kitty now requires less food, since she's more full from eating less of the higher quality food and we make sure to only feed her what the vet recommends,) I no longer have to drive to the store and pick up a 40 pound bag of dog food and load it into the back of one of my GTIs. So far, Kitty's been gaining weight and muscle at a pretty decent rate, in my opinion. (Over the past 2 months, she's gone from approximately 59 pounds to 67.5 pounds currently, and is quite fit and happy.) All this, is of course in addition to daily exercise, walks, et cetera, but her temperament lately has also been much better. On the lesser quality dog chow, she used to mope around the house every few days, but lately, she's been very happy, energetic and outgoing. She seems to be much less easily stressed out, which is great for her, as she tend to be a bit anxious, although an absolute sweetheart.<br /><br />Bottom Line: I could not recommend this or any other Canidae Dog Food product highly enough. By word of mouth at work alone, I've converted over ten people since switching at the beginning of the year (2011)."

I'm actually starting to wonder if there was some mistake or I got a fluke bottle of 357, because its the hottest thing I have aside from my Da' Bomb lineup.

It is twice as hot as the original so there that is. I also have Ultra Death sauce now too. Its not much hotter than the Mega Death that I can tell.

I know, I'm whipped.  But be honest, if your thinking of buying these you probably are too.  Chances are good your cat will like them, mine do much of the time.  But they also like other flavors much of the time.  Price is a little more but packages are larger.  One strange thing with Amazon, different flavors of cat treats are different prices, even though they are all Temptations, Friskies, Party Mix, or whatever."

What I now know is that  tons of protein is not always the best for every breed.  I started my three little dogs cavapoo 15 lbs cavachon 12 lb yorkie 5 lbs on Wellness Core which is I'm sure a wonderful food but the protein is rated at 36% which turned out to be far to rich for my little dogs. After talking with the breeder of my yorkie she explained that too much protein in some breeds can be taxing on the liver and kidneys. I saw this in my dogs right away so I knew I had to make a quick change.  I definately wanted to eliminate the gas and copious amount of poop do to the protein content so I checked with the other foods made by Wellness and found that the simple five mix has a lot of the same wonderful ingredients as the Core but with a much more practical protein content for my dogs life style at 28%.  The results were amazing, immediately I saw a reduction in the amount of poop fewer times outside as well.  Everybody seems happier and life is easier with all three dogs on the same kibble.  I'm THRILLED.  Thank You WELLNESS.  I would strongly recommend this product.  One more side note...I really appreciate the promise made by Wellness on the front of the bag.  IT STATES: NO meat by products corn or soy  and so on.  Check it out for yourself you will be glad you did:)"

It is human-grade food and full of every good thing. It is very, very easy to make, and meal-time has become a big deal in my house -- they all sit with wagging tails as I prepare it. When I stayed at my mom's house for a couple weeks, her two dogs were much more interested in having my dogs' food than their own regular dog food. I originally bought this food because I wanted to put my dogs on a vegan diet. For the protein source, I use tofu and all sorts of beans like chickpeas/garbanzo beans, black beans, etc. They love it no matter what I add to it. I rotate the type of oil I use, or sometimes I use a blend. When I first put them on this food, I used the serving size they recommend, and my dogs started gaining weight. So I am actually able to use less than what they say in the instructions. I have three 50-pound dogs and I use approximately 1 scoop per dog, twice a day. In the 10-lb bag there are about 198 scoops, in the 5 lb bag there are around 99 scoops, in the 20 oz bag there are around 24 scoops. So from that you should be able to calculate a good estimate of the cost for your dog(s). Of course for smaller dogs you can use less. With my finicky dog, I used to have to stand over him and goad him into eating his commercial dog food (which even contained meat). Now he scarfs his food every time! One other note: I sometimes add some Nature's Recipe Vegetarian formula dry dog food just to add some crunch. For vegetarian/vegan treats, I feed them Sam's Yams and C.E.T. VeggieDent. It is a wonderful thing to be able to give my dogs a cruelty-free diet! And we never have to worry about all those crazy dog food recalls!"

When I saw this<br />I thought I would try it and give him the same sort of treat as I do the cats.<br /><br />First of all, he loves it. He practically kisses my feet when I give it to him. It has an odd texture, in my opinion. Sort<br />of similar to a handful of raisins, not quite dry but? And Duncan gobbles it up and clearly wishes for more. I have a<br />fairly spoiled dog. Due to health issues, I cook for him every week. He eats cooked fish, beef or chicken with rice or pasta<br />peas, and some supplements. So if I ever do give him dog food in any quantity at all, it is a very high quality, not so yummy<br />as this ( apparently) dog food. So I am very concerned with what is in the food he is given. I see no problem with a tablespoon<br />or two a night for my 70lb dog, but I would not feed this as his sole diet. The nutrition value is very low, which is usually the<br />way it is with the food dogs like best.<br /><br />So, I really wanted to give this a higher rating since he likes it so much, but since I am writing this for dog people who are<br />surely interested in keeping their dogs healthy as well as happy, I had to go with two stars.

I usually drink my latte without sugar but since this already had a little and not enough at that, I sweetened it a little more. As a latte it was actually not bad.<br /><br />The taste is a little bland (not talking about strength but flavor) but I'm accustomed to making my own coffee from different beans so I wouldn't mark it down that much. It says it's 100% Arabica but that doesn't really tell you much since the most common bean grown is C. arabica. Is it the dregs swept from around the world or is it the finest hand picked? Coffee taste itself is very subjective so all I'm saying here is that the taste is not very specific to a region that I can tell. I really have to give kudos for Coca-Cola for trying to make a canned presentation out of a product whose taste is so personal and difficult to please.<br /><br />It doesn't have any caffeine information on the can but I wonder if they juiced it up because it gave me a buzz that I only usually get when I drink extra concentrated coffee.<br /><br />I would think that cans like this are meant to be drunk cold from the fridge or from a cooler and unfortunately I didn't think to save some of it to drink with ice or cold. But overall I think it's an OK substitute for someone who needs his coffee fix when there is absolutely no cafe around and it's not too bad for a situation like that."

It should have worked, but I just think they misunderstood the things that make the classic Worcestershire so appealing.  Maybe they just opted for smoked anchovies or something, but this sauce has an unpleasant smoky, almost bacon-y undertone to it.  I've tried it again and again, hoping I'd get used to the difference, but in the end I had to chuck it in the trash.  From a man who has ordered and enjoyed multiple gallon jugs of Tabasco Regular and Habanero Sauces: this one is just not a winner."

310944,B00064VQNU,A2UVPDFQEB8Z9R,"Raymond Martin ""Monty""",73,78,5,1192579200,The Great Olive Oil Scandal and why you should use Bariani,"The problem with most of today's olive oil is that it is rarely produced in the old way, which is more time consuming and expensive. Due to the increasing demand for olive oil, the trend has been to reduce production costs by moving toward more automation and concentration of production in ever larger installations. These modem factories extract more oil more cheaply, but their processing methods substantially reduce the nutritional quality of the oil.<br /><br />To reduce costs, olives are machine harvested along with leaves and twigs. Olives that have dropped on the ground, which can be said to contain bad oil, are often mixed with the good ones. They are shipped in all kinds of containers, many of which are poorly ventilated, and heaped in large piles where the olives are stored for too long and often become moldy. The oil is then extracted in a continuous centrifuge where hot water is used to help separate out the oil.<br /><br />Antioxidant polyphenols are soluble in water and are washed away in this process, thereby lowering the shelf life and the nutritional quality of the oil. Italy alone produces 800,000 cubic meters of waste water per year from this process. Because substantial amounts of antioxidants are washed away, factory produced olive oils have a short shelf life of only months, whereas real olive oil lasts for two to three years.<br /><br />Most people think that by purchasing ""extra virgin"" olive oil they are getting a high quality oil.  Unfortunately, in most cases, this is not true. It's more complex than that. A label reading extra virgin is no guarantee of quality. For one thing, nowhere does it say that extra virgin olive oil has to be made 100% from olives.<br /><br />Lower quality oils can be refined to bring the acidity down so they can be labeled as extra virgin. But now the oil has been refined, and that's not what you want. That's why being labeled extra virgin is no guarantee of getting high quality oil, which has not been processed in ways that reduce its nutritional value. To complicate matters even more, the term ""extra virgin"" has no official meaning in the United States. The U.S. is not a member of the International Olive Oil Council. So, olive oil sold here can be labeled extra virgin without meeting the accepted international standards.<br /><br />Another reason why you can't trust extra virgin olive oil is exemplified by a problem that manifested last year, and may turn out to be the biggest food fraud of the 20th Century. Despite the fact that details of this scandal have been published in Merum, a Swiss-German magazine, and in Italian journals such as Agra Trade, and the newspaper Gazzetta del Mezzogiorno, this information has been successfully suppressed and is known to only a handful. Investigators are gathering evidence indicating that the biggest olive oil brands in Italy have for years been systematically diluting their extra virgin olive oil with cheap, highly-refined hazelnut oil imported from Turkey. International arrest warrants have been issued and so far documents indicate that at least ten thousand tons of hazelnut oil are involved. As much as 20% hazelnut oil can be added to olive oil and still be undetectable to the consumer. In fact olive oil labeled ""Italian"" often comes from Turkey, Tunisia, Morocco, Spain, and Greece. Considering what has happened in Europe, where there are strict regulations, imagine what can happen in California where there are no regulations. Apparently, more oil is ""produced"" in California than there are olives available. The truth is, most of the extra virgin olive oil on the market does not supply all the nutritional value and health giving properties that we have a right to expect from olive oil.<br /><br />The bottom line is that modem, factory-produced olive oil has been stripped of its health enhancing nutrients, and the task of selecting a high quality oil has been made very difficult.<br /><br />Bariani olive oil is produced by the Bariani family on a small farm in the central valley of California. Their olives are grown without pesticides.  They are hand picked from the trees, carefully washed and dried, and milled with a stone wheel within 48 hours of harvesting. It is pressed in a hydraulic press, collected in stainless steel vats, decanted, and bottled.  This first cold pressed oil is the real stuff and retains all the natural flavor and goodness."

I ate pretty well when the kids I was with turned up their noses at these bits of real food.  The cocoa karob, specifically, was just too far removed from the candy they wanted in a bar.  This was food.<br /><br />These things rock.  It's really a food bar, though they get lumped with energy bars a lot.  They have a ton of complex carbs, good fats, fruits, fibers, food, etc. lumped into a hunk that you can easly find room for in a backpack.  Then, provided you have enough water to get some portion of it down... you're good to go.<br /><br />The flavor is not very exciting, and the bars are very dense.  The fruit and nut is fairly sweet, but not what I would call a fruit bar.  I prefer the cocoa karob, which is less sweet and seems to have less of the malty flavors going on in the fruit and nut.<br /><br />I've taken these for ultra trail runs that had no aid stations.  They are a must on backpacking trips.  I grab them when I need food during the day, but am not going to get a full meal in.  I can eat these fairly regularly without getting too tired of them, and unlike all the other bars out there, when I eat a Pemmican bar I feel like I have eaten something.

Granted, if you're used to grocery-store jerky, then this is still a much better product. But if you've acclimated to chemical-free jerky, then the ""smoke flavoring"" that they've recently started adding tastes like, well, smoke flavoring, and not the real thing.<br /><br />You may not notice a difference. Apparently jerky is one of those things where you notice a down-shift in flavor, even when you wouldn't notice an up-shift in flavor. (Like margarine eaters think butter tastes fine, and powdered milk drinkers think cartoned milk tastes fine, but when people do the opposite, they find the tastes terrible. Jerky is the same--if you upgrade from convenience store jerky to premium you might not notice it, but when you downgrade from ""the real thing"" to anything else, it tastes distinctly artificial.)<br /><br />I used to buy this in bulk every few months (with a discount per Amazon Subscribe & Save), but the change in flavor made me double-check the ingredients list, and I found that the new ""smoke flavoring"" was added when they changed packaging. So this jerky is good, but not worth the premium any more. If anyone has a suggestion for an all-natural replacement without ingredients like ""smoke flavoring"" I'd appreciate it, since I'm now searching for something new."

36649,B004CLCEDE,A3P8ACNCKHOZ06,Jessica Higgins,4,4,5,1341273600,Fantastic addition to stir-fry; delicious if you cook them right,"I heard about these noodles years ago through Hungry Girl, although they weren't available in my area's grocery stores until just a couple of years ago.  When I learned 2 years ago that I am gluten-intolerant (borderline celiac), I started using rice pastas and the like, but they weren't all that satisfying and still had a ton of calories and simple carbs.  Remembering the stories I'd read about shirataki, I thought I should give them a try.  I had initially tried a different brand (one of the tofu varieties).  I must admit, the first few times I tried shirataki noodles, I was really unimpressed, but I was pretty much just rinsing them and adding them to whatever I was making, but once I learned how to properly cook them, even the other brand was really good.<br /><br />The best way to prepare them that I've found is a little bit involved, but they are still very quick and simple.  I put about a teaspoon of oil (grapeseed) in my 9"" nonstick wok and preheat it on high.  I open the package of noodles directly into a colander, letting the liquid drain out (it smells a little like shrimp to me, but YMMV), and then open up the hot tap over them for a couple of minutes.  I then shake/squeeze out the excess water, sometimes blotting on some paper towels, then snip them with kitchen shears until they are a more manageable length on average (although sometimes I do this directly in the pan, just because I'm weird and that seems fun).  Transfer the noodles to the pan.  The oil should be hot and the noodles should sizzle when they hit the pan; grapeseed oil has a very high smoke point, which is why I prefer it for stir-frying.  I tend to use silicone-covered kitchen tongs for cooking my noodles, as it seems easier to grab them and turn them than trying to just stir.  I let them cook for a couple of minutes until they are more or less dry, then add my other ingredients in order of how long they take to cook.  You really can't overcook shirataki noodles (in my experience), though - they don't get soggy like wheat pasta.<br /><br />My favorite recipe is to add 6 oz. medium raw shrimp (usually I just rinse/thaw the shrimp and noodles together in the colander, then separate them as even raw shrimp doesn't take very long to cook), 1/2-3/4 cup of chopped green onion, 2-3 tsp of liquid aminos (or light soy sauce), a beaten egg or two, and a dash of ginger & garlic powder at the end.  The noodles take a back seat to whatever ingredients you add, and are just a nice addition that also tends to be very filling.  I calculated this recipe in a diet log, and it checks in at under 400 calories for what amounts to a HUGE bowl of noodles with 6 oz. of shrimp and two large eggs.  Tons of protein and very filling for very few calories.  Even my exceedingly picky husband likes them, and he isn't rummaging through the fridge & cupboards 10 minutes later like usual.  Last night I added some frozen grilled red & yellow peppers in place of the shrimp, and it was outstanding.<br /><br />I like these because they are not only gluten-free, but soy-free.  While I don't actively avoid all things soy, I do try to keep my intake in check, mostly because of how ubiquitous it is in nearly every other prepared food product (especially gluten-free).  I'm still curious about the nutrition measurements, considering the package describes them as being made of soluble fiber, but lists &lt;1g of fiber in a serving.  In any event, I am always full and happy after a meal containing these."

Now, as a jug is emptied I put a couple of heaping tablespoons of this stuff in it, fill it with hot water, and set it on top of the fridge to do its thing overnight.<br /><br />In the morning I pour out the citric concoction, and wash out the inside with a scrub brush, and, voila, the inside is sparkling clean!  It's like a miracle, and I love that it's not some chemical concoction that could possible leach into my beverages.<br /><br />Note that I also used the same technique to clean out the plastic reservoir for our dog's water bowl.  Great stuff at a good price!"

This is the exact reason I bought them because I'm trying to lose the last few pounds while gaining muscle. The thing is though that I still think Jack Links tastes better.  Jack Links Slim Jims are high in fat however but on the other side there jerky is low in fat and on top of that around 20g of protein per pack. I gave this product a 5/5 because it was so low in calories and still tasted good but I will say when I finish off with this last bit of body fat then Ill probably switch over to Jack Links because the higher amount of protein. Still great product because it's healthier, 5/5 stars."

Really. Much more spicy than tabasco or any other ""commercial"" sauce you might get, so if tabasco is NOT spicy for you, this is probably up your alley. If tabasco is a spicy sauce (not a flavoring agent--b/c it is actually quite tasty in it's own right, just not super spicy) to your taste, this will probably overpower your taste buds.<br /><br />Use sparingly and build up the amount you use over time--what's spicy in is usually spicy out, if you know what I mean, so if you're not used to it, you'll be sorry!"

I went in with hopes that combining two good things together would result in something better than the two separately.  In this case the result is pretty good.  While this is only mentioned on the product page (and not the actual container itself), the lid doubles as a measuring cup for a single serving.  After having these over the last few days, here are my impressions.<br /><br />While I like the taste (a lot!), it wasn't exactly what I was expecting.  When I think of dark chocolate, I'm expecting a taste similar to a piece of Dove Dark Chocolate miniatures.  It is a taste that is rich with a very mild sweetness.  The coating on these almonds is a little bit sweeter than that.  It's nowhere near milk chocolate, but like I said it wasn't exactly what I expected.  That said these are still really good.  The almonds themselves are great with only a minute amount of salt.  With the chocolate and the natural flavor of almonds this is a sweet treat.<br /><br />Who It's For:  Disciplined people looking for a sweet, but healthy snack.<br /><br />Suggested Use:  A single serving makes a great between meals snack.  If your stomach starts to rumble around 10 a.m., this will bridge the gap to lunch.  I have the canister in a desk drawer at work.  Regardless of when/where/how you use them as snack, discipline and moderation are key.<br /><br />Potential Improvements:  The one thing that bugs me on these is that the 11 oz package does not divide evenly into 1.5 oz servings.  It would seem like a 12 oz canister would have been easy enough.<br /><br />Overall:  This is a great tasting, healthy snack to enjoy in moderation."

The cloth ribbon and beautiful wrapping paper covered a wonderful gold cardboard box. Inside was arranged the prettiest little squares of chocolate. The romance ended after I ate this chocolate.<br /><br />The box contains a somewhat random assortment of seven different chocolates. Each piece of chocolate is six grams, and the box should contain exactly the same number of each variety. For reasons that are impossible to understand, there were only five orange and three Feuilletine chocolates; but over a dozen dark chocolates.<br /><br />Why I was disappointed with these chocolates - the flavor and texture.<br /><br />The nibs are dark 55% cocoa chocolate with little tiny bits of crunchy chocolate particles. The chocolate is slightly sweet, the texture is coarse, and it does not melt evenly. The nib particles seem like bits of coffee bean or sand in the chocolate - not a very pleasant texture.<br /><br />The Dark chocolate is also 55% cocoa but much lighter in color than the nibs. Several bars in my box had bloomed - the texture was extremely hard, melt was very slow and uneven in my mouth. Overall the flavor was not great. I love dark chocolate. These squares were just not to my liking at all.<br /><br />White chocolate is fabulous in the hands of expert chocolate makers. The version we are used to is almost all sugar and a really bad substitute. Great white chocolate is somewhat sweet, but typically has a very pure clean chocolate flavor and aroma; along with a smooth melt. This white chocolate should have been like the great version, instead it was exactly in the middle - a bit too sweet, and dull chocolate flavor. Fortunately, these seemed to be much fresher than the other chocolates in the box.<br /><br />Feuilletine is a 32% cocoa milk chocolate with bits of wafer in the square. The wafers contain gluten. The chocolate is too sweet and left an oily film on the roof of my mouth. The melt was uneven. The wafers were a distraction, not enough crunch like a Kit Kat, but just enough to annoy the melting and leave tiny crunchy bits in my mouth.<br /><br />Milk chocolate is 32% cocoa product. Like the Feuilletine, the chocolate is too sweet and left an oily film in my mouth. It also had a slightly bitter aftertaste.<br /><br />Orange is a mix of dark 55% cocoa chocolate with natural orange flavoring. The orange is subtle, not overpowering. But the base chocolate is just not a good example of particle size, texture, and flavor. It had the same problems as the nibs and dark squares.<br /><br />The best for the last, there was one decent chocolate in the whole box - Pure Origin Sao Tome - 72% cocoa. This variety is good, but does not rescue the rest of the box. At this cocoa level, the chocolate has to be really good; there isn't enough sugar to mask problems. Compared to some of the better high percentage cocoas, this is about the middle of the pack. Melt is pretty good, not perfectly even but not coarse. There is an initial good tart flavor that slowly goes away. The aftertaste is the biggest problem, a kind of dry powder and bitterness left in my mouth.<br /><br />The molding on all of these chocolates was not good. Every square had bubbles or imperfections on the back of the square. If the chocolate is the correct temperature at molding and tempered properly, the back of a bar will be perfectly smooth.<br /><br />I was truly expecting a box full of heaven from Leonidas, smooth, sweet, lovely chocolates that I could enjoy slowly. The packaging was beautiful; the contents were just not outstanding. Although not packaged as beautifully, but at the same price point I prefer Valrhona, Cote D'Or, Milka, Lindt, or imported Nestle."

The price over time, however, is all over the place and buyers must be cautious.  More than a year ago, I began ordering this variety under Amazon's Subscribe and Save program at about $20 for a pack of two 24-count boxes.  Later, with no apparent rationale other than supply and demand, the price shot up to $38.  I immmediately started using other decaf K-cups.  During this time, I saw a listing that appeared identical to this Timothy's variety that I had been ordering at about $20, only to learn when it was delivered that it only included only ONE 24-count box and not two as before.  Effectively a 100% price increase!!  Nice try, but I quickly sent it back as misleading and not as described. Recently, the price came down again to about $23 for two boxes, although no longer available under Subscribe and Save.  Still, it is a great product so I placed orders over the past couple of months.  Now, after a couple of months, at the end of April 2011, the price has again risen to $38.  Is this a ""bait-and-switch"" tactic by Amazon or its supplier thinking that buyers won't notice the price increase?  The coffee deserves 4 to 5 stars but the misleading pricing brings my rating down to 2 stars."

On a whim, I checked Amazon and was so happy to find that they sold them and they were a pretty good price too.  I was little worried about ordering chips online, the expiration date, shipping and how we were going to get through all of them.<br /><br />No worries!  Only 3 bags left  - my husband and I love them.  The shipping was A+, with double boxes and air bags.  The chip bags are puffed up and you will need clippers or scissors to open it.  I don't mind because I think that's why they are so good and crunchy, not like the Guiltless Gourmet ones that taste like stale cardboard.  We make it to the bottom of the bag with very few crushed chips at all.  The fresh by date was 3 1/2 months from my date of purchase.<br /><br />The best part of all is the taste and nutritional quality of these chips.  One serving has 120 calories with 3 grams fat, 3 grams protein and 3 grams of fiber which for chips is pretty good.  Yes, they are not like blue corn regular chips with twice the fat, but they are the best ones out there that are baked.<br /><br />I will definitely be reordering again!"

However, it would actually have been even better if the folks at Honey Maid had put these in packets about half this size, so that my family and I could have a single serving per pack in our lunches.  As it is, they're very calorie-laden and one little pack should be about two servings of crackers, which leaves you needing to store the other two or three until you're ready for them, meaning you'll need another bag to hold them in the mean time or some other method of keeping them from leaking graham crumbs and sugar all over your bag.<br /><br />All in all though, these are a great idea.

Non bitter, smooth bold medium-dark roast.  It is one of my personal favorites.  But the purchaser should be aware of how this coffee is packaged. It works great in the Keurig machines but the packaging is not a true K-cup.  A K-cup, as designed (and probably patented), is a small plastic cup sealed with a foil lid, under which is a coffee filter pouch of a single serving of coffee.  The packaging on this does not have the plastic cup encasing the foil lid and filter paper pouch of coffee.  I suspect the manufacturer is saving in paying licensing fees from using the K-Cup design by excluding the cup.  But you have to use different storage containers for these packages, as using the usual racks and other means of storing K-Cups will allow air to get to the coffee and cause it to go stale unless stored in an air-tight container or plastic bag.  Also, this packaging may not work in Keurig brewers that automatically dispose of the spent K-Cups.  Another slight inconvenience is that the brewed package leaves a wet coffee filter sack of coffee grounds, whereas with a genuine K-Cup, the spent package only has one small hole in the bottom of the plastic cup, the rest of the package is dry upon disposal handling."

Enzymatic Oral Hygiene Chews. they are just as good for the dogs teeth without the chance of staining plus are less costly. also my dogs do tend to gag on them once they've chewed the large size piece down small enough to where they think they can just swallow it whole. eventually they do spit it up and realize they need to chew it a bit more. the product and my dogs vet mentions that the C.E.T. chews are easier on digestion than other rawhide chews so i don't feel as concerned with my dogs swallowing the small pieces."

However, while the cereal itself is ""not bad"" it's lacking in many areas.<br /><br />First and foremost it's not made with whole grains like Honey Nut Cheerios is.  Another reviewer put it nicely when they said this is equivalent to eating candy for breakfast.  The amount of sugar and refined carbohydrates is way too much for any type of health benefit whatsoever.  The peanuts are so small and in such small pieces (more like granules) that I don't consider them anywhere near enough to consider any health benefits from the nuts.<br /><br />The taste itself is good, and it's a bit softer of a crunch than most cereals, but outside of that it's just too many carbohydrates to be on the breakfast table.  Kellog's could really improve this cereal by getting rid of some of the added sweetners and switch to a whole grain recipe.  Until then, if you like sweet cereals with little health benefits then this is for you -- but otherwise, stick with Honey Nut Cheerios."

So even using garden ties, velcro, etc, the plants are always flopping around.

Scherner,0,1,1,1348185600,"If Your Kids are Stupid Enough to Think Water is Cool When It's In a Bottle with a Cartoon Character, Then Fork Over Your Cash","Each of the different Wat-aah! varieties have themes. I picked up the Power theme at the Natural Foods Expo, and I asked the guy what made it different. He looked a bit stunned, but he pointed out the magnesium in it and then looked at me blankly. That's one of two things wrong with the company's marketing. Everything else is spot on--well, except that they're selling water, and they're selling it to parents who should be making their kids drink water whether they want to or not. But that would require parenting. I digress.<br /><br />The other thing wrong with this product is the label copy. I don't know what the other bottles say, but I'm guessing kids aren't buying this water, so the label copy SHOULD sell the parents rather than the kids, but I would think the parents would reject the water, based on the copy. The copy explains to kids that they should fight to drink this cool Wat-aah! Power instead of spinach, because of the magnesium, which is apparently the only value in spinach. I digress again. The label even says that spinach ""is green and sticks in your teeth"" in comparison to the water that ""comes in a cool bottle."" Right under all of this is a Fight Childhood Obesity logo. Right. So, I'm going to bring something into the house that argues against them eating spinach, AND that helps me fight childhood obesity how? Now, I'm not saying that spinach is the answer, but do I need a company marketing themselves as a substitute for something else that is good for kids? Moreover, how could they think that's a good idea, a selling point to adults with critical thinking skills?<br /><br />Well, apparently they do. This water is marketed based on its cool bottle. But it's just water and some of the usual ""special"" stuff that is often in water we buy. It's also marketed to give kids ""buying power"" with the cartoon front and the spinach argument. Frankly, I'd rather any kid of mine didn't rely on marketing to make a product choice, and oh, guess what: they are kids. They don't get to make the product choices.<br /><br />The company has somehow made the right connections, gotten the right endorsements, achieved school distribution, and is conducting a social media campaign that is textbook perfect. Too bad they're also selling water and the idea that marketing to kids (and marketing to them in a way that doesn't support eating leafy green vegetables) is a good thing. If it wasn't for the mixed message on the copy, maybe I could accept that it's marketing like sugary cereals do: to the kids. But this product just teaches kids that bottled water is good. It's not a horrible lesson, but parents should be teaching their kids through the parents' buying power--not the kids. When they get a job, they can buy spinach-replacing water. And eat their damn spinach."

Very sharp taste--not exactly tart, but just this side of it. Satisfying is the word that comes to mind. I don't add sweetener or anything--think it is perfect just the way it is. I can get three cups of tea out of one tea bag, although the last cup isn't quite as dark colored. This tea delivers on a lot of levels, because it not only tastes great, but is also a beautiful, deep-vibrant red. I've read Hibiscus is very good for a person, but even if it wasn't, I would still drink it for the taste. The fact it is organic just about makes it perfect in my eyes."

Packaging, no other boxes or bags were used or necessary.  Review of the value: this is going to put it in perspective;<br />1) The average size bags are about 1.69 ounces<br />2) The larger size bags range from 9-11 ounces depending on which one as they make several.<br />3) This bag was just over 42 ounces and they go up to 60 ounces in certain packaging.<br />In theory you could go out and buy a bunch of the 1.69 ounce packages and to equal the total of about 84 ounces and at about $1 a bag you'd only buy about 48 bags at $.99 a bag it would be cheaper to go with these bags - however, the cost of this item was a little disappointing because I expected a little more in the bags.  Aside from a portion (probably 25% of the height) of the bag being air, I was just hoping for more M&M's.  Overall I give this purchase a C+ value as it was cheaper to buy this way.  But, as always beware of pricing for example another seller on Amazon charges $9.19 for the same bag (but you have to pay for shipping).  If you wanted to buy using Amazon Prime, like myself then you could get regular M&M's (no peanuts) for only $15.63 - about $10 less so that may be worth the savings.  An okay value - but at the end of the day it was cheaper than buying them individually. 73beats"

Yet, I can no longer afford to frequent the fine tea rooms and tea stores that I used to, which offered my favorite varieties and international brands.  Subsequently, I've had to settle for lessor quality brands sold in most major supermarkets.<br /><br />Knowing how much I enjoy superior tea, my daughter-in-law chose Bentley's Finest Royal Green Tea Collection Gift Set as a holiday gift.  I could not have been more pleased!  *I regret that I delayed writing this review. Yet, with Mother's Day approaching, I'm hoping for another gift set.<br /><br />Bentley's Royal Green Tea is a superb collection of fine tea which is equal in quality and taste to some of the world's best green tea I've enjoyed.  This elegantly wrapped gift-set offers 6 varieties of special blends of green tea and fruit blends, from exotic fruits to popular favorites, such as Mango or Raspberry.<br /><br />Each teabag is securely sealed in a beautifully designed packet, with an elegant artistic image representing the fruit which flavors that teabag.  Bentley's goes further by providing a sturdy wood-like case, designed with 6 separate sections, each section containing 6 teabags of one flavor.  This solid well-designed dark-green case holds a total of 36 individually wrapped tea bags in its six compartments; a case which aptly resembles a jewelry box for the true 'jewels' of exquisite fine teabags it holds.  Indeed, when you lift the firm lid on this elegant case of fine tea, you will know you have a treasure-chest of great varieties of fine green tea.<br /><br />I was especially impressed that each teabag was expertly measured and prepared to effect the perfect aroma and optimal taste for the average teacup.  No other green teabags comes close to the perfect brew one would expect from the finest loose tea sold in specialty tea stores and tea rooms.<br /><br />Whether you purchase Bentley's Finest Royal Green Tea Collection Gift Set as a gift, or for your personal use, you will not be disappointed by the suburb quality of this wonderful selection of fruit-flavored green tea.<br /><br />Maizie Lucille James<br />April 2, 2012"

This Natural Granola was the first `Bob's' item that I had tried out because I knew it would be more versatile for adding into other recipe's and I could simulate his other granola mixes because I always keep spices and dried fruit bits on hand (for adding to foods AND ESPECIALLY to reconstitute for natural sweeteners).<br />~ THE #1 THING THAT I""VE LIKE THE BEST ABOUT THIS GRANOLA is that it seems so filling to me that I've naturally and effortlessly reduced my portions, which is important for getting our stomach's back to a healthy / natural size without unpleasant brain associations or, in my case triggering my hypoglycemia).  THE #1 ADVANTAGE FOR EVERYONE ELSE WOULD BE HOW PHENOMINALLY VERSATILE THIS NATURAL GRANOLA IS FOR COUNTLESS DISHES & MEALS, SOOooo NEVER assume that healthier eating has to be tasteless, bland or boring !!<br />~ Breakfast Suggestions:  For my taste I didn't need to add much sweetener at all, it's great either with just cold milk, or when I cook it I add in a little ginger and/or cinnamon (VERY health-benefitting spices) plus either a bit of honey or a sparse touch of molasses (bolder flavor and much cheaper than honey), or I sweeten it with a touch of stevia leaves or reconstituted dried fruits (in winter).  BUT, I also add some granola to my pancake mix, muffins and sprinkle it into my cooked 10-grain cereals to add some interesting texture.<br />~ Snacks: After realizing how filling (AND nutritious) it was, I tried out several of the easy, home-made granola-mix recipe's that I found online and saved it in the smallest Rubbermaid containers; it always filled me up when I was debating between a snack, a sandwich or a `meal'.  It's so much-healthier-than-cookies and far more environmentally friendly than the over-priced 100-calorie snack-packs, I also learned to add it to yogurt cups to make it more filling and to feel fuller longer, and I've begun trying some very-healthy low-cal cookie recipe's which I've added this granola (only making them about the size of most cookies)<br />~ Cooking:  You can add this granola almost ANYWHERE you use fillers or bread crumbs, including (but not limited to): adding some to the coating for your veggies or meats before frying, definitely add some to your stuffing / dressings to add flavor to FINALLY retain a better-than-mush texture, experiment by adding some to soups, stews or even chili for more substance and for a passive thickener (no kidding!), it made my sloppy-joe's and meatloaf more awesome than ever, it can add healthy nutrients and texture to almost any casserole (replace those unhealthy French-fried onions!) and it definitely goes great in goulash;<br />~ Baking: FIRST, if there's any chance that anyone is allergic to nuts, use granola for a fabulous substitute.  I've been having so much fun, success and getting raves by adding this granola to muffins, breads, graham cracker crusts, carrot / coffee cakes, BREAD PUDDING, cookies, pies (again acts somewhat like a mild/passive thickener), into the filling of bundt cakes, it's phenomenal in carmel/sweet-rolls, IT'S FABULOUS in frostings like caramel-coconut over german chocolate, and I'd better stop before your drooling shorts out your keyboard :)<br />~ SOME FINAL TIPS:<br />#1): When whole-grain portions are adjusted DOWN to natural, nutritional-needs-sized portions (and you'll see this echoed across numerous product revives) these cereals ACTUALLY ARE LESS EXPENSIVE than the mega-processed, bloating cereals we've been media-blasted into becoming addicted to.<br />#2): We humans DO have the adequate brainpower to begin incorporating healthier ingredients into our families diets within your means; such as: we can purchase JUST ONE PACKAGE of most of the Bob's products at most local grocery stores for trying them out, experimenting and adjusting to them,  then save money by ordering, pantry-ing and saving money via the larger quantities here on Amazon.  I've now purchased several more of the `Bob's' products like the 10-grain cereals, Flaxseed, etc., WHICH I've also been adding into my recipe's; the point is that WE CAN find numerous ways to add a little more nutrition to our meals.<br />#3):  IT'S FUNNY how my family members (and their boyfriends/girlfriends) have been liking my healthier recipe's so much that they've begun to ask more about the recipe's and ingredients.  And after their initial shock that they actually liked things that were very nutritious, they're needed to address their negative prejudices about genuinely healthy ingredients and foods and have begun opening their minds (I WISH THAT I HAD INSISTED ON MAINTAINING MY VALUE OF NUTRITION BEING THE HIGHEST PRIORITY WHEN MY CHILDREN WERE SMALL).<br /> #4): I'm betting that Bob would agree that whether we choose his products or a similar product or the most nutritious that we can afford, we've all got to realize that there are countless reasons (the health care crisis being only one reason) why we absolutely must improve our eating habits AND try to be as environmentally considerate as we do so.<br />#5):  I have successfully tried several of the recipe's that are printed on the `Bob's' packages, but while I was at the library the other day I noticed a Bob's Red Mill Cookbook and `Baking Book'!  Although I was too short on time to investigate them, I knew that if I had found dozens of ways to successfully incorporate these healthier ingredients into my dishes and meals, imagine what they could offer with all their experience and resources, I ordered it here on Amazon and I'll recommend that everyone at least consider look into their cooking books if you're serious about learning to incorporate healthier ingredients into your dishes and meals."

I've found a way to eliminate gas in my younger sheltie - mixing the dry kibble with a bit of hot water and letting it sit for 5 minutes before feeding the furry kids.  For some reason, my younger sheltie's tummy finds this easier to digest and now he doesn't have gas at all.  Woohoo!  So now I'm able to feed more of this kibble, they get twice as much of it than they used to.  I think I've been feeding this Canidae Grain Free to my dogs for almost 5 years now, and my dogs have never had an upset tummy.<br /><br />By the way, buying directly from Amazon for this item says ""Usually ships in 3 to 4 weeks"", but 1-2 days after I order I'll get an update email from Amazon saying something like ""Good news - We're able to ship this sooner than we thought!  Your item will be delivered a week from the date you ordered.""  And sure enough, it arrives within a week of ordering.<br /><br />**Original review**<br />I feed my dogs the Canidae grain-free All Life Stages food (now called Canidae pureElements, I don't think Amazon has updated the photo or name of this food yet but the ingredients haven't changed) - why the Grain Free variety?  My younger sheltie has epilepsy.  Gluten and corn are possible seizure triggers, so I feed both my shelties a wheat, corn, & gluten free diet.  Canidae is only part of that diet;  I feed them 4 small meals a day - 1/4 cup Canidae Grain Free ALS, then a 4"" piece of raw turkey neck, then veggies for the last two meals.  The last meal is sometimes another 1/4 cup of Canidae instead of veggies.  I know, it's complicated, right?  But my dogs really do better on a mostly raw diet like this.  I still use kibble because it's the fastest way to feed them a meal first thing in the morning before I let them out to go potty.<br /><br />I've fed a variety of kibbles from the natural pet food shops, some with grain and others grain free, and when I fed them an all-kibble diet (Canidae or other brands) my younger sheltie had TERRIBLE gas, while my older sheltie had anal gland problems where she'd have an anal sac blowout at least once a month.  So gross, but that's why we covered our couches in blankets that were easily washed.  (Gosh I hope you're not eating lunch while you read this review.)  Anyway, I started giving them more raw food and the gas has disappeared and my girl sheltie no longer has anal gland issues.  Their teeth are cleaner too.<br /><br />I didn't want this to turn into a ""raw food is the only way to go"" preaching session, I swear!  But for my dogs, raw is better - it's easier for my younger sheltie to digest so he doesn't gas us out of our home, and it gives my older sheltie firmer poo so her anal glands work like they're supposed to.  Canidae doesn't help my dogs' particular issues like raw does.<br /><br />However, Canidae is a heck of a lot easier and cheaper to feed, and my furry kids certainly do love Canidae's taste, they inhale it.  If your dog doesn't have weird kibble digestion issues like mine do, then Canidae Grain Free ALS is a 5 star dog food.  For my dogs' sensitive systems, it's a 4-star food.<br /><br />The Canidae Grain-Free All Life Stages has a 34% protein level, which seems to do better with my shetland sheepdogs' stomachs than the higher protein kibbles.  I've fed another brand of grain-free kibble (Innova EVO turkey & chicken) that had 42% protein which was too high for them to handle even when switching to it gradually and only getting a 1/4 cup a day... 42% protein made their poo liquid.  So, I've stuck with Canidae's grain free ALS.<br /><br />I've also done a 50/50 mix with the Grain Free ALS and the Grain Free Salmon, the furry kids love it.  The Salmon variety smells like FISH, big surprise, right?  I try not to breathe when dishing it out, don't care for the smell of fish like the pups do.<br /><br />As I write this, Amazon's price is the same as my local natural pet store.  As much as I'd like to support local business, my local natural pet store is terrible (it's a long story), so I buy Canidae here on Amazon.<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />Chicken meal, turkey meal, lamb, potatoes, peas, chicken fat (preserved with mixed tocopherols), lamb meal, ocean fish meal, tomato pomace, natural flavor, choline chloride, suncured alfalfa meal, inulin (from chicory root), lecithin, sage extract, cranberries, beta-carotene, rosemary extract, sunflower oil, yucca schidigera extract, dried enterococcus faecium fermentation product, dried lactobacillus acidophilus fermentation product, dried lactobacillus casei fermentation product, dried lactobacillus plantarum fermentation product, dried trichoderma longibrachiatum fermentation extract, vitamin E supplement, iron proteinate, zinc proteinate, copper proteinate, ferrous sulfate, zinc sulfate, copper sulfate, potassium iodide, thiamine mononitrate, manganese proteinate, manganous oxide, ascorbic acid, vitamin A supplement, biotin, niacin, calcium pantothenate, manganese sulfate, sodium selenite, pyridoxine hydrochloride (vitamin B6), vitamin B12 supplement, riboflavin, vitamin D3 supplement, folic acid, papaya, pineapple."

139752,B001BCXTGS,A1ZM846Y7AUYD,M. Pickering,3,3,4,1228176000,Healthy Feline Cuisine For Your Finicky Cat(s),"Most people know that cats can be finicky eaters.  They devour some food and simply walk away from others.  I guess that is one trait that I find most interesting about our three Bengal cats.  They can eat like horses and yet are rather picky about what foods they will eat.  They all like tuna, ham, and even beg for a potato chip from time to time, yet they don't seem to care for turkey and even some types of cheese.  My family and I love our cats very much, and we are concerned about their health and want to feed them nutritious food.  Since all of our Bengals love chicken, I was delighted to recently have the opportunity to try the new Petite Cuisine Chinese Chicken and Chicken Pot Pie Variety Pack.<br /><br />We received a 24 pack, which includes 6 individual boxes, each containing two 3 oz. cans of Sesame Chicken and two 3 oz. cans of Chicken Pot Pie cat food.  The ingredients for each flavor are as follows:<br /><br />Sesame Chicken Entr&eacute;e:  Chicken, Chicken broth, Carrots, Sesame oil, Soy bean oil, Rice, Tricalcium phosphate, Guar gum, Tapioca starch, Calcium sulfate, Salt, Vitamins & Minerals (Vitamin E, Vitamin A, Vitamin D3, Zinc sulfate, Thaimine mononitrate, Manganese sulfate, Menadione sodium bisulfite complex &lt;source of vitamin K>, Riboflavin, Folic acid, Pyridoxine hydrochloride, Copper amino acid complex, Iron amino acid complex), Carrageenan, Choline chloride, Taurine.<br /><br />Chicken Pot Pie Entr&eacute;e:  Chicken, Chicken broth, Sweet Potato, Carrots, Soy bean oil, Tapioca starch, Tricalcium phosphate, Guar gum, Calcium sulfate, Olive oil, Vitamins & Minerals (Vitamin E, Vitamin A, Vitamin D3, Zinc sulfate, Thaimine mononitrate, Manganese sulfate, Menadione sodium bisulfite complex &lt;source of vitamin K>, Riboflavin, Folic acid, Pyridoxine hydrochloride, Copper amino acid complex, Iron amino acid complex), Carrageenan, Choline chloride, Taurine.<br /><br />As you can see, the ingredients in the two flavors are nearly identical.  One controversial ingredient contained in both flavors is Menadione Sodium Bisulfite, which is a synthetic version of vitamin K.  MSB has been called ""potentially harmful"" by many researchers, and is not allowed in human food.  However, the FDA does not restrict the use of MSB in pet foods, and these pet foods are even able to proudly claim ""Natural"" on the label, even if it contains this un-natural ingredient.  Studies indicate that Menadione Sodium Bisulfite can be toxic in high doses, and the tests indicate that this synthetic vitamin supplement can prove toxic to kidneys, lungs, liver, and mucous membranes.  Since I only use the Petite Cuisine food as a supplement to my cat's regular food, I don't consider the levels of MSB to be high enough to put my animals in any danger.  However, it is up to the owner to determine if they find this risk acceptable or not.  You can find more information about Menadione (Vitamin K3) here:<br /> http://www.dogfoodproject.com/index.php?page=menadione<br /><br />The manufacturer website (http://www.petitecuisine.com) says that ""Petite Cuisine is People Food for Cats.""  There is no wheat gluten, no grain fillers, and no meat byproducts.  The label on the cans says ""Product of Thailand"", and the website boasts that nothing about this food is sourced from China.  All of the meat and vegetables are steam cooked, and each variety is hand packed into each and every can (according to the manufacturer).<br /><br />We have been feeding the Chicken Pot Pie and Sesame Chicken Petite Cuisine entr&eacute;es to our three Bengal cats for the past several days now.  We dispense one can onto a saucer for all three cats to share, once each day.  One thing my wife and I really like about this food is that it doesn't have an unpleasant odor, like most canned pet foods.  It smells like chicken and gravy, and although neither of us are daring enough to try a taste ourselves, our noses tend to support the claim that this is ""people food for cats.""  The chicken pot pie entr&eacute;e contains several chunks of white meat chicken, along with small bits of sweet potato and carrots, all swimming in an ocean of gravy (or broth, sauce, or whatever you wish to call it).  The food looks good, but I feel that there is just too much gravy, and it could prove to be messy when serving or during feeding.  The sesame chicken entr&eacute;e contains shredded chicken (not chunks), along with bits of carrots and rice in a far more reasonable amount of gravy.  Both entr&eacute;es look good and smell good, but how do the cats like it?  Well as we observed our cats when we served up the food, here is what we found:<br /><br />Chicken Pot Pie Entr&eacute;e:  Asia, our 3 year old female Bengal, greedily devours the hearty chunks of chicken and veggie bits, but leaves most of the gravy behind.  Neo, our 10 month old male Bengal, also enjoys the chicken and licks up quite a bit of the gravy, but doesn't seem at all interested in the bits of sweet potato and carrots.  Matrix, our 2 year old male Bengal always approaches the food, sniffs at it for several seconds, and ultimately walks away without eating any.  Matrix will take a little taste, every now and then, but isn't interested in eating any quantity of it.<br /><br />Sesame Chicken Entr&eacute;e:  Asia again scarfs down the chicken and veggies, but leaves behind the rice and gravy.  Neo seems to eat a little bit of everything.  Matrix again sniffs at the food but will not eat any of it.<br /><br />So overall we have encountered very mixed results with our three cats.  Of course they are cats, so being somewhat finicky is only natural.  Two of the three seem to really enjoy the Petite Cuisine chicken entr&eacute;es, while the third doesn't care for it at all.  So would we buy this variety of Petite Cuisine in the future?  Well I think we will likely try some of the other varieties first, to see if we can get all three cats to enjoy the food.  Petite Cuisine also makes Yellow Fin Tuna, Red Snapper, Tuna & Sole, Tuna & Shrimp, and New England Crab Cake varieties, which all sound like something our cats would like.  We are going to order the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BDDTB2"">Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (Yellowfin, Snapper, Tuna & Sole, Tuna & Shrimp) for Cats, 3-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, and see how our cats like these varieties. My wife and I both feel that Petite Cuisine produces great quality food, with high quality ingredients, and we will certainly buy more of their products in the future.  I do admit that I wish they didn't use the synthetic Vitamin K supplement (Menadione), simply because so many others have expressed real concern about the potential risks of this ingredient.  Many other manufacturers have removed this ingredient from their products, so maybe PetPlay, Inc. (makers of Petite Cuisine) will omit this synthetic ingredient in the future if enough consumer concern is expressed.  I do recommend the Petite Cuisine chicken varieties of cat food to other cat owners, but do so with a bit of caution due to the inclusion of the controversial Menadione Sodium Bisulfite ingredient.  If Petite Cuisine tastes as good as it looks and smells, then I am sure all but the most finicky cats will enjoy it a great deal."

I use a half packet of lemon and Orange, 1 packet of stevia, and a short squirt of cherry per liter bottle. Now the flavor falls between generic and brand name.  Cheaper than using cans, but not cheaper than using two liter bottles.  The calorie count is about a third of normal cola.  You have to be comfortable with Splenda and Ace-K as Soda Stream uses those to offset some of the sugar (not corn Syrup a plus).  Thankfully no Nutrasweet/aspartame as I get terrible headaches from that."

I keep buying different types of tea convinced I'll like them, and each one turns out to be completely different than I anticipated.

But this tea is completely different.<br /><br />I love licorice. This tastes exactly like licorice. It smells like licorice (clearly from the anise, since licorice root basically smells like cooked bark). It doesn't need sugar. It's sweet. It has an 'aftertaste' of licorice. In other words, it's perfect.<br /><br />Unfortunately no store I've ever been to has carried it, although I look EVERY TIME I walk down the tea aisle.

I've tried a weird Celestial tea  mix of  licorice root + 3 other things (tastes like hot water), Batavia Anise tea (hot water with a licorice aroma), and store brand Albrecht Heijn Zoethout tea (from the Netherlands - smells like hot bark but tastes exactly like this tea. Unfortunately it's completely nonexistent here.) What I've discovered on my quest fs that only a few brands even attempt to make JUST licorice tea (it's not popular here, and it baffles me that people don't appreciate the taste), and of those only Stash is successful.<br /><br />Buy it.

While it still has a bit of vitamins in it, it doesn't have as many as some of their other lines do. (Presumably so they can fit those skin improving elements in!) This shouldn't bother anyone unless they are specifically drinking CL in order to get their daily vitamins. (If you're only getting your vitamins from CL then there's something wrong with that picture!) This drink has no caffeine, so if you are abstaining this is a good one to have. If you need caffeine, well... there's still several other CL drinks to have.<br /><br />Now onto what you really want to know: does it taste good & does it work? Taste wise, it's fantastic. I'm a big fan of tea but not caffeine, so this works out really well for me. The peach element is very good but not overpowering. It's a bit sweet, so people who don't like overly sweet things may want to stick to the pomegranate lemonade skin essentials. I'd still give it a try. I was a bit skeptical about whether I'd like it or not, but ended up adoring it. As for whether or not it works skin-wise, I can't honestly give a real answer yet. I've only been drinking it for about a week or so, off & on. I can say that I've noticed my skin getting silkier & a bit softer, which is enough for me to keep drinking it! (Well, I'd keep drinking it for the taste as well!)<br /><br />Now for price. Getting it from amazon... maybe not such a good idea if you are looking for value. You could honestly find it cheaper at your local grocer's. HOWEVER, if you are in an area where there's not a good selection of CL or far from a proper grocer's, it may be more convenient to order online & have it shipped to you. Then again, it could end up that even if you do live next to a well stocked grocers, ordering from amazon could still be more convenient to your work & life schedule."

Lation ""houseofmyths""",51,51,5,1286236800,Here is great idea for simplifying your wheatgrass growing in the Master Sprout Sprouter!,"Here's is something that will simplify your wheatgrass growing IMMENSELY!  Begin by soaking about a half-cup of wheat berries (hard winter wheat is usually recommended) twelve hours (more or less) and allowing them to sprout for three days or so.  When you are ready to spread these little sprouts out into your sprouter, first fit one sheet of natural, untreated paper towel in the bottom of the sprouter (you can find these untreated paper towels at almost any healthfood store).  You do not need to trim all the extra around the edges because after dry fitting, you will moisten the paper which will cause it to cling to the sides making a nice neat little container.  You can moisten the fitted paper towel with kitchen sink spray or soft-pressure kitcen faucet water.  Sometimes we moisten it from a kelp-water spray bottle.  Either before or after fitting and moistening the paper towel to the inner contour of the sprouter, try cutting off about an inch and a half triangle from one corner of the fitted paper towel.  This will give you an open corner from which to make later draining of the growing sprouts MUCH faster and easier.  It is also helpful to mark one corner of the sprouter itself so that later on as you are rinsing the growing wheatgrass, you will know where the open draining corner is located.  This will be helpful to know if you want to lean the sprouter at an angle to allow the extra rinse water to run off for a minute.<br /><br />Next you spread the sprouting wheat evenly along the bottom of the moistened paper toweling.  I usually like to come back and spray them with the kitchen sink spray to help distribute them evenly over the bottom of the container, but this can easily be done with your fingers.  If you wish, at this stage you can spray the spread with kelp water.  Then place the container in some window light ... direct sunshine is NOT necessary or recommended, and rinse twice a day ... or more the first few days if you have time. Two will do.<br /><br />After you have chewed or juiced or otherwise ingested your wheatgrass crop and are ready to clean out the stubble and roots, all you have to do is start at any corner and pull out the entire mat in one piece.  The paper towel helps hold the roots (not all but enough to make an easily remmoval one-piece mat)together inside the sprouter.  Once you have disposed of this large mat of roots and stubble, the sprouting container is very simple to clean.  The entire process (removing the remains and cleaning the now empty container does not take me longer than three or four minutes...maybe less.  It certainly has taken me far longer to write this review.  I once tried two layers of paper toweling and the results were nothing like as positive as just the one layer.  Nothing else that I have tried this layering with (except garlic for which I prefer to use a cut piece of Sure-To-Grow (the most economical way to go here is with the 20-foot grow rolls) or nothing at all.  The paper towel layering did not work well at all for buckwheat greens or sunflower greens.  I grow both of these in just a plain empty Master Sprout spouter (large and/or small).  BUT FOR WHEATGRASS, I have never had such great crops with such an easy and fast clean up as with this single-layer, natural paper towel process. Also, I do tend to spray all of my growing sprouts with liquid kelp-water solution, (but you can get plenty of beautifully green crops without it).  The really good news, as far as I am concerned, is no more soil for either wheatgrass or sunflower greens, etc.! Now that I have retired and am living in an apartment, soil is out...paper towels and Master Sprout spouters (with or without paper towels) are in. I hope no one will allow the complications of soil prep, etc. to keep them for great wheatgrass growing.  Also, with these Master Sprout sprouters, other greens for which soil has long been recommended can be grown soil free, e. g., sunflower greens and buckwheat greens.<br /><br />Oh, and one last idea.  The Easy Sprout sprouter is the perfect way to start absolutely everything and for beans (which don't need to be greened). I've been sprouting for over thirty years, and I have never before found it this easy and I credit that to the combination of these two sprouting system.  I don't see how it could be made any easier.  The two together cover all of our sprouting needs: Easy Sprouter takes care of starting all sprouts for later transfer into the Master Sprout containers AND it covers the complete sprouting of beans which do not need greening.  Master Sprouters take care of all the things that need greening.  I am sprouting and cooking for two and make full use of three Easy Spouters, 5 Master Sprouters (the regular larger size), and 3 Master Sprouters (mini).  I keep three wheatgrass sprouters cycling for a constant supply; buckwheat greens and sunflower greens (for salads); garlic and a variety of beans (mostly for soups and stews).  All that is needed for this is one 48-inch wide diningroom window with a 20-inch by 48-inch wide folding table to hold the sprouters in the light.  The Easy Sprouters stay in the kitchen.  As you can see, the entire operation  does not take up much space and yet it gives a much appreciated large quantity of live food year round.  Rinsing takes no more than ten minutes twice a day."

She is very food motivated and we're yet to find a dog food she won't eat, however, she's struggled with acid reflux issues and all night 'hiccups' for most of her life. So I was excited for the opportunity to try HIlls Science Diet Ideal Dog Food to see if it would help her with this issue. I am also very pleased to be feeding her food with NATURAL and REAL MEAT ingredients as it makes me feel better about what she's taking in and the quality of the food. Not surprisingly she took to the food right away. I've never been one to like the smell of dog food, but I certainly didn't find the smell to be any more offensive than any other food like the other reviewer mentioned. I actually placed out a piece of 3 different types of food in front of my dog and she immediately whe went for the Hills Science Diet Ideal Balance food, so I'm guessing that she found it to be more appealing too. Although I haven't seen a HUGE improvement on her reflux issue, it has seemed to helped a bit and I'll take any help I can at this point. In fact, she's only been on the diet a few weeks now, and I know it generally takes a bit longer for it's full effects, so I'm very optimistic that it will provide even more improvement in the future. The only negatives I have about the food are that I had a hard time opening the bag and the top actually ripped open so I wasn't able to use the reasealable closure (but that could've been due to my impatience), and it seems to be a bit pricey.

It was overkill, but the canned goods arrived without a dent every single time.<br /><br />Now, on my third shipment in a row, at least one can is dented, and we are talking massively dented to the point where on this 12oz can if you put another on top it won't stand straight because the top is now at an angle.  The problem is they use these tiny boxes barely large enough to contain the cat food cans, and the bubble wrap is just these extra large bubbles only placed on two of the four sides, leaving two sides exposed to UPS who inevitably dents most of the cans on those sides.<br /><br />I don't consider this UPS's fault, as they handle so many packages they can't afford to treat them like raw eggs, its Amazon's fault for repeat inadequate shipping.

At 12 years of age, she is far from training age where I could use these as training treats, but historically, she has loved chicken flavored treats more than any other flavor of treats.  That is why I bought these treats, and she has loved me for it from day one.  She has a habit of prancing on her hind legs over to me when I get out her treats and she hears the bags crinkling.  However, with these treats she runs towards me and starts standing on her hind legs so excited to get these treats.  I have never seen her so excited to get a treat in her 12 years with me.  I think that goes to the quality of the treats, and to her love of her master when I give her these treats. LoL.<br /><br />My dog is a small Rottweiler at about 65 pounds.  However, that is big enough that I have to give her about 20-25 bits each time I give her these treats.  Times three times a day, that is a lot of treats.  I am certainly glad I purchased four bags of these Best Buddy Bits.<br /><br />I will have to tell you that until I received my shipment from Amazon, for some reason, I thought these treats were named Best Buddy BITES.  I do not know how I made such a blunder.  Imagine my embarrassment (in front of my dog since she was the only one around) when I realized that I had been wrong this entire time. Oh well, at least I am certainly straight on the name now!<br /><br />One last item, the Crude Fat (min) level of these treats is 13%, it is a bit more than I usually like to give my dog, but I will overlook it on these treats because she absolutely goes bonkers for these treats.

The dog was eating my bed. So I go into the bedroom to scold her and even before I get a chance to look at the bed frame, I am struck by the mess she has caused. The Busy Bone somehow leaves little brown crumbles ALL over the floor. Too small and numerous to pick up by hand and too gushy for the vacuum cleaner to clean up, the oobleck has to be washed out of the carpet with a dish rag.

It is definitely the best baby white cheddar cheese popcorn I have tried.  For those who love strong cheese flavour, this is the strongest you will find (at least that I know of).  I wish they made it in extra sharp, but they probably wanted a ""middle of the road"" cheese for the majority of consumers who might find extra sharp too strong for them.<br /><br />In any event, there really aren't that many companies that make baby white popcorn with cheddar cheese in the first place.  The larger-sized corn and yellow corn just are not the same quality as baby white, cheese or no cheese.<br /><br />That crap made by Smartfood that is sold in the markets is horrendous (not to mention lots of partially popped kernels).  The popcorn made by Deep River has less hulls because it is baby-sized, which is better for the digestive track (especially for those of us that are older).  Also less partially popped kernels than the other brands I have tried.<br /><br />There is great popcorn out of Colorado (Cornzapoppin) made fresh just before shipping, but it is full-sized.  The flavours are great, but there's just nothing like baby white corn (did I say that already?).  It's also rather expensive, but does make a great gift for those you want to spend money on.<br /><br />So until someone else makes a high quality baby white sharp cheddar popcorn, I am loyal to this Deep River Snacks product!"

The seeds are mostly tasteless so they won't adversely affect the food or drink they've been added to. This is my first experience with chia seeds and I could not be happier. Looking to find an egg replacement for recipes, and having had mixed results with flax seed which sometimes alters the taste, I set out to try the chia in as many different recipes as possible. The recipes ranged from cookies to muffins and cupcakes, breads to pancakes, and they've all turned out terrific; the seeds worked just as well as eggs and I feel better about it. In place of 1 egg, 1 tablespoon of chia seed with 2-3 tablespoons of water, soaked for 15-20 minutes, worked out best in my baking experience. They are also great in homemade granola bars, tossed into both cold and hot cereals, and in smoothies or juices. The versatility of the ""superfood"" the Aztecs and Mayans revered is amazing. The nutritional benefits, which are many, of chia seeds can be found by an internet search, but a some of them include: omega-3 fatty acids, fiber, protein, essential minerals, and rare antioxidants.  I'm sold and I highly recommend <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0054TWQMM"">Nutiva Organic White Chia Seeds, 14-Ounce, 2-Count Pouches</a> without reservation.

The new bottle, first of all is plastic.  Thats fine I have no problem with that,  that shouldn't effect the product. I noticed the color of the mix is a lot darker than the original Postum, almost like it has oil in it or is wet  and less ""grain like"" in its consistancy, more like  a fine sawdust. After comparing the two bottles side by side the moment of truth was now at hand.  I cracked the seal on the little white paper stuff that covered the top of the bottle.  To my suprise there was almost no smell. I do remember the original postum having a distinct smell when you stick you nose an inch or two from the bottle,  and this hardly had any odor to it.  I took my 1 spoonful of mix and dumped it into a hot cup of water.  It created a ton of foam as it mixed in,  which I dont rember the original doing.  I then poured my  small amount of milk in it, and it turned a very light color.  I added a touch of sugar and prepared for the taste.  the first sip was kind of flat.  I had to ask ""did I put way to much milk in,  or not enough mix?""  well,  I finished most of the cup and found myself a little let down.  to me the first cup didnt seem like an exact match to the good old Postum of 2008.  Weak on aroma and a little weak on taste.  I will experiment alittle with the mixture and see if I can improve it,  but I probably won't be buying another bottle.  Were my expectations to high?

I grew up on Good Seasons dressings and have used them for well over forty - ok, almost fifty years now  - yes, they have been around that long!  They are the best tasting salad dressings out there, and while I've used many, many other dressings over the years - from bottled to homemade - the Good Seasons Salad Dressing family is my favorite.<br /><br />Back in the 60s I think we always made the dressings with vegetable oil and apple cider vinegar, but after I got out on my own and widened my food horizons, I find I love Good Seasons even more. Vinegar is the big secret with these dressings - change the type of vinegar you use and you dramatically change the flavor!  In the 80s I started using red wine and white wine vinegars, which gave it a whole new taste.  In the 90s Basalmic vinegar was the way to go and my foodie friends were never so impressed!  Now my vinegar of choice is a rice vinegar, especially with the Zesty Italian and this flavor - Garlic and Herb.  But other vinegars are great too - try it with malt vinegar for a change of pace.<br /><br />My other trick is that I now make my dressing with a healthier canola oil, rather than the vegetable oil of the old days.  I've also made it with olive oils, but I don't use olive oil as a general rule, only because the oil solidifies in the refrigerator and you have to take it out ahead of time to soften it.  I'm just not that good at planning ahead, so I'll stick with canola.  I also use a bit more of both the oil and vinegar than the package recommends - I like the taste a bit better and I get a wee bit more dressing for each package.<br /><br />And now that I've found my favorite salad dressing on Amazon, life just got better yet.  The prices in the grocery stores had gone way up over the years to over $2.25 a pack, but now I can buy 16 to 24 packages of dressing for over a buck per package less.  Thanks Amazon!"

The name and the description really pulled me in, as well as the picture on the box. At first I was confused as to what the taste reminded me of, but then I realized it reminded me of pink Necco mints. I don't drink sugar in tea, but I think if I did and I had put some in this tea it would've made it overbearing. However, after drinking this tea once every day for a week or so, I'm finding it to be almost like a chore. I love the health benefits and this tea has actually helped me feel pretty good after drinking a cup, but the taste is becoming a bit overbearing. As I mentioned early in my review, the taste is reminiscent of pink Necco mints (minus the mint part, of course) but it can be hard for me to get through a cup of it because after awhile that Necco taste begins to remind me more and more of chalk. Yes, it definitely has a chalky flavor. I will still continue to drink this tea until the box is gone but I don't think I'll be buying any more of it unless it has some sort of miraculous effect on me later on down the box. Still, it was worth a try because it was nice at first."

We've always enjoyed hazelnut coffee in the past, though, and vowed not to give up.  I ordered a sample pack of Wolfgang Puck's hazelnut directly from Keurig's website and hoped for the best.<br /><br />Thankfully, Hawaiian Hazelnut blows all of the other hazelnut k cups out of the water.  It is smokey and delicious without being dark and overwhelming.  The hazelnut really does taste like actual hazelnut, which you'd think would be something a coffee drinker could take for granted, but we've been disappointed in the past.  I'd never tried coffee from the Wolfgang Puck brand before, but our positive experience with Hawaiian Hazelnut has definitely gotten me interested in trying other varieties.<br /><br />The hazelnut flavor is pretty bold and full bodied, which is nice, but there is no bitterness or acidity to be found.  This suits me just fine since I enjoy a milder roast, but people who enjoy their coffee strong and dark might not enjoy this blend as much.<br /><br />We'll definitely be repurchasing this coffee when we run out."

137575,B000E46GG4,ADWL6PX6QM3ZJ,Generic,1,1,4,1336348800,"Tastes good, large servings","1) SERVING SIZE: The amount of oatmeal per packet is almost twice as much as you get from other oatmeal packets like Quaker or Dr. McDougall's. Note that the box weight and number of packs per box in the Amazon item description is likely wrong (it was for me); zoom in on the image photo, instead, for correct weight and count.  If you are making this for kids, you might even feed two small kids with one packet.  When comparing the price, calorie count, carbs/sugar, etc. of this oatmeal to other brands, you can't compare it based on number of packets and price of the entire box alone, because you are probably getting almost twice the amount of oatmeal in these boxes of Nature's Path Organic oatmeal.<br /><br />2) COOKING: Because these packets contain more oatmeal, I needed to add about twice as much water than I would normally add to cook Quaker oatmeal (makes sense!) and about 30 more seconds of cooking time.  Then after I remove it from the microwave I add a few dashes of cinnamon and some milk to get the perfect consistency, just as I do with other oatmeal brands.<br /><br />3) TEXTURE: This oatmeal has a heartier texture, especially with the nuts.  I personally don't like the nuts.  They add a cardboard flavor and unwelcome crunchy texture to an otherwise delicious and smooth cereal, in my opinion.  I know many actually like the added texture and think the nuts taste good, so this is simply a matter of personal taste.  I'm guessing some kids won't like the nuts either.<br /><br />4) TASTE: The taste is not as sweet as Quaker oatmeal or even Dr. McDougall's, but it doesn't really need to be.  The level of sweetness is a tad shy of ""just right"" for my taste, not enough to add extra sweetener, which is healthier for me to accept the less-than-sweet taste and enjoy the natural goodness. It tastes very good as it is (aside from the nuts -- just personal opinion).<br /><br />VERDICT: However I have to admit that overall my favorite oatmeal is still Dr. McDougall's Light Maple Brown Sugar oatmeal.  Dr. McDougall's oatmeal is the perfect size serving for me (about the same amount as Quaker's) and I prefer the taste of Dr. McDougall's between the two brands.  It is just a little sweeter than Nature's Path Organic, but still not as overly sweet as Quaker's."

We bought ours at Costco which came with 1-130L Co2 Carbonator, 2 1-Liter Stainless Steel Bottles and trial flavors pack for $99. First let me say I'm very pleased, the flavors are not bad at all and i can use my own filtered water from either the fridge or Pure faucet attachment and no longer need to pay or bring back bottles for the deposit. They also have much less sodium than store bought soda with the exception of Diet Rite.<br /><br /> I have tried many diet flavors and the ones i like the best are Orange, Caffeine free cola, dr pete, Fountain Mist, Cream Soda and Root Beer. As for the cost it has changed everything, no longer have to pay deposit, return empties or search for sale price on soda which means lot less trips to the store saving me from impulse buying and gasoline usage. I can now make fresh bottles of soda whenever I need it (unlike store bought soda which can lose carbonation)  and any flavor I feel like at the time. Already used up  1- 130L Co2  carbonator bottle so ordered 1 full bottle + 1 exchange for empty bottle from SodaStream web site this way I'll always have one full bottle when one is done. You should always search the web for coupons for any online store before ordering and SodaStream is no exception, saved $15 which is the price of the license on a new bottle.  So it cost me the same as if ordering to exchange 130L Co2 Carbonators, pretty sweet. If you order 10 bottles of syrup at a time you get one free  and with on line coupons and cashing in points your earn from them with every purchase can save you more than just the shipping cost, the cost of a trip to the store. For me the SodaStream is well worth the cost."

After many fruitless searches at nearby Asian markets to try a few packets, I ended up getting a case from Amazon after several months of hesitation; what can I say...I have to try all ramyun that I notice. Upon trying, I must say that I'm not disappointed at all and this is my new favorite ramen for the moment. The broth is thicker (from the beef bone extract powder) and has a bit of miso flavor very similar to the restaurant quality Japanese (non-instant) miso ramyun. It is definitely not as spicy as the regular Shin ramyun, but it has much more complex flavor and tastes more home-made with bigger chunks of mushrooms, hot peppers, etc. It is unbelievable that the product is MSG free with its play on all my taste buds, and I was very impressed that the product didn't make me feel as tired as most ramyun usually do after consumption. I'm very happy that I still have many packets left, and I'll savor them for all they're worth, which is actually much cheaper than comparable restaurant ramyun and home-made noodle soups."

I think they are shipped 1 day delivery, but if it is hot, the chocolates may arrive slightly deformed.  This did not detract from the taste.

Yes, it does have a slight vanilla taste but it's vague and not overpowering. Sweetness level is good, like drinking a light fruit juice. Like other fruits and vegetables, coconut waters are going to taste different depending upon what region of the world and variety they come from. I prefer Thai sourced coconut waters (both Taste Nirvana and Zico come from there). If you find a water you like try other brands from the same country (I believe most others come from Brazil).<br /><br />I enjoy drinking it as a healthier alternative to sodas or the more sugary fruit juices (I don't consider it a wonder drug). It's especially nice on hot days when you want a lighter beverage but with more flavor than plain water.<br /><br />If it were cheaper I'd drink it everyday."

Being labeled Thai spicy and living in Thailand I expected this product to deliver a wallop of flavor and, unfortunately, I got a small sweet kiss of what could have been. A valiant effort but way of the target. Would I eat it again? Yes if free or highly discounted. Would I give it to a Thai friend as a gift.

It possesses few spots on grocery shelves and has shared little in the ""gourmet"" coffee line which changed how people accept this ancient drink into their lives. Comedian Bob Irwin even compared the blend to ""kissing your sister."" The day's first cup comes with a sense of entitlement; subsequent cups transition through the day (work, afternoon, dessert), while wanting both coffee's jolt and cozy sociability. (Instant? Don't get me started!)<br />That's why this new Melitta Riviera Sunset gourmet coffee is a pleasant surprise. It carries a full, almost nutty flavor without the bitter bite of the coffee which, for many, defines their image of coffee and its lifestyle. (This isn't surprising since Melitta's ad copy references the breezy feel of European cafes, a far cry from the irked lines at the morning coffee shop.)<br />No less than Henry Ward Beecher once said. ""No coffee can be good in the mouth that does not first send a sweet offering of odor to the nostrils.""  Riviera Sunset invites with its scent upon opening and doesn't disappoint when poured.(Hold to the preparation instructions; yours truly made one cup a little too strong and it came across a bit acidic.) Its taste, not its caffeine jolt, is your wake-up call. Recommended as a tastier, if somwhat pricier, alternative to major brands."

Keeping in mind the size of my dogs, these treats are the teeniest, tiniest things I think I've seen. Maybe an inch long and 1/8"" high/deep, the dogs' canine teeth are bigger than these treats. Keeping in mind a treat this small will most likely be swallowed whole, I distributed them slowly to each pup. It was as if they were gulping air...I don't think the ones with enough teeth to chew even tasted them. The 2 with minimum teeth for whom I must moosh everything up got theirs crushed up in yogurt...those two girls wouldn't eat the yogurt. So, I can't tell if my pups like these or not; most didn't even taste them as they went down the hatch too quickly without chewing; the other two didn't like what they did to their favorite treat since losing their teeth, yogurt.<br /><br />They are wheat and corn free, listed as 100% natural and the ingredients list on the back of the little box are:<br />oat flour, rolled oats, potato flour, chicken broth, carrots, celery, canola oil, eggs, baking powder<br /><br />For the price, one can put those ingredients together at home (I will swap potato flour for whole wheat flour) and bake them yourself. Even if it takes a few tries to get the measurements right, the dogs will still eat them and you can make them any size that is appropriate for your pet(s). If baking them as hard treats is too time consuming for you, do what I do: mix it up like a meatloaf, bake it, cut into appropriately sized treat pieces, and keep in the frig. Easy enough and one can use leftovers from a meal rather than start with all new ingredients. Probably healthier for your pet too.<br /><br />However, we must still thank Auntie for allowing us to try something new.

I try more and more to buy food that are more natural and less processed.  These claimed to be full of vitamins and 100 percent of the required nutrition.  That might be the case, but my cat sure didn't get all of his nutrition.  Where as he would drink all of the liquid from the seafood flavors, he didn't much care for the abundance of chicken flavored gravies.  The large amount of gravy and small veggies in the Chicken Pot Pie flavor were not to his liking.  He eventually ate pretty much all of it, but not right away - which for a large cat on a diet like my cat - is ultra rare at my house.  He actually begged for something to eat while he still had the rest of the Chicken Pot Pie in his bowl.<br /><br />This food makes some good claims about the quality and I agree the food does look better than anything you get from a local Superstore for 25 cents a can.

If my cat doesn't like it today, then imagine what it will be like in a week when he has had it 7 days in a row.  More than likely most of these cans will go to the dog just so they won't be completely wasted.<br /><br />If you also tried this pack and your cats turned up their noses to it, then I'd recommend the Petite Cuisine Variety Pack of seafood flavors instead if your cat is more of meat-eater than a vegetable / gravy eater."

Red Bull works wonders for me.  If I take it at 10pm, I have great focus and concentration and I can stay up working all night long through to the morning.  But Sugar-free Red Bull has no effect on me whatsoever.  I can take it at 10pm and fall asleep 10 minutes later.<br /><br />'5-Hour Energy' has a very similar effect on me as Sugar-free Red Bull.  Which is, basically, nothing.  That said, '5-hour Energy' appears to be more likely to (1) give me a headache, (2) make me lethargic, (3) and make me want to go to sleep.<br /><br />So, if you are like me and need sugar for Red Bull to work for you, then likely this '5-hour Energy' drink won't do anything for you either."

I'm glad I didn't buy the whole package. If you like richer hot chocolates, then you will not like this. I tried making this hot chocolate on all three settings (smaller, medium, larger cups on the three option Keurig machines). All of the options tasted too watery for me. I would often add creamer to try to substitute for the lack of flavor to them.  If this is a machine you have in your office and are looking for something different than coffee, it is, like the stars-rating claims, okay. It tastes like what it is - a mediocre hot chocolate they added to a coffee line to simply offer variety.<br /><br />Personally, I prefer to just use Swiss Miss packets and use the Keurig to heat the water. You get better taste (by a company known for hot chocolate) and the convenience of the Keurig machine. Plus, you save a lot of money."

The packaging of the nuts were good and they were fairly fresh. However, there were some problems as well. The picture on amazon gave a picture that made it look more full, when it's really 1/4 of the amount of nuts you see in the picture (the world of advertising). I was a little disappointed to rip open the box and not see what I thought (although it did state 6 ounces, but I could not mentally picture it).

Sorry folks---we've been hooked on iced tea for 50 years! Anyway, we don't drink wine or beer, and water/carbonated beverages got old in the tropics. In Germany, for three years we longed for having iced tea with our schnitzel! This year we tried taking a few small bottles of MIO in Peach Tea and Sweet Tea flavors. Outstanding! Made a LOT of difference, whether at meals or just drinking bottled water. Advantage over powdered flavorings is that you can adjust the strength of the mixture a squirt at a time. (What would you do with a glass of water, but with an envelope of powdered flavoring for a quart of water?) And, for those concerned about passing airport security,  these contain only 1.6oz.  Use 'em at the office for drinks during the day. Very convenient."

Since it cooks slowly, I find it a snap to catch the al dente point. I was using Tinkyada pastas and I still will for lasagna, fettucini etc.. but this spaghetti wins hands down for texture, taste, everything. I agree that it should be noted that it is made from mostly corn (which is non-gmo) with quinoa (organic) as it's 2nd ingredient for those with corn sentivities.<br />My only complaint is that 8 oz packaging is a bummer. Coming from a long line of Italian chefs.. We really love our pasta, so I have to cook 3-4 boxes per meal. That gets pricey.<br /><br />Try this brand!!

Though they are both considered ""medium sized"" dogs, we give them the Large dog biscuits because they THINK they are large dogs.  Normally they each get one large biscuit every night before bed.<br /><br />So the box came in the mail.  I admit that I was surprised when I opened the box that more of them weren't smashed or broken in transit - I generally can't get the box home from the grocery store without smashing half of them.  So they now have a box full of non-broken snacks.  As the doggie mommy I inspected the ingredients - and was a bit dissapointed.  Lots of wheat and grains.  I had hoped for at least animal by-product or something as the first ingredient.  What really bothered me was the fake coloring, there's a list of artificial dyes - now I've never met a dog who would turn anything away based on color so I don't understand the point of colored dog treats.  The last ingredient was added on vitamines - so I was happy about that.  Still, lots of salt, sugar and grains in the box.<br /><br />Then I read the directions - feed 2 biscuits twice a day, so that's 4 biscuits per dog per day... that's a LOT of snack food for a dog.  After closer inspection it seemed to be stating that for maximum DENTAL benefit to follow that feeding routine.<br /><br />Rosco, our 30lbs 2year old sheepdog figured out pretty quickly that the box contained snacks.  After a sit then shake, I gave him one.  He was curious at first (he's a cautious doggie after having been abused so badly) there was some sniffing, some poking with the nose, but then once his big brother started moving in - Rosco crunched happily away at it.<br /><br />Indiana Jones (aka IndyBear) our 60 lbs 12-13 year old mix (maybe spaniel and austrailian shepherd? Who knows) has been on a weight management diet for over 10 years now, but severe arthritis and hip displaysia prevent much excercise.  Indy will eat anything - though I have recently started to worry about the hard food on his teeth.  Once Indy figured out that we were testing new biscuits, he went through the routine, sit, shake, laydown, situp - then he took off with his new snack.  Indy wolfed it down and came back for more.<br /><br />Over the next 24 hours there were no upset tummies or 2am walks due to the ""runs"" so we'll at least finish off the box.<br /><br />Final Opinion:<br />The Good - hard and crunchy to help prevent additional tartar buildup.<br />Apparently very tasty.<br />The Medium Size is good for the 25-40 lbs weight range.<br />I liked the added vitamins.<br /><br />The bad/questionable - I wasn't a fan of the dyes included.<br />Smaller or older dogs may not be able to chew these comfortably.<br />The dental benefit is only to PREVENT NEW buildup - not to help with current dental issues.<br />Feeding Directions may lead to plump puppies - especially with the ammount of non-meat ingredients.<br />Doesn't seem that it would be as beneficial on the teeth as a rawhide, at least with my dogs.<br /><br />Please remember - Doggies need their teeth brushed too, even if you give them hard treats like these."

Recently I spotted a pack of these almonds in one, shook it out, and gave it a shot. I hadn't tried them before since they were in the 'healthy' vending machine where the cheapest thing is a fiber cookie for nearly one Abe Lincoln. But hey, when almonds are free, I won't turn them down. Almonds are already great on their own, and these suckers add other great ingredients to the mix, making for an excellent snack.<br /><br />You get the usual crunchy almonds, apples, flax seeds(!), balsamic vinegar, sea salt and red peppers. Flax seeds make everything better, in more ways than one, and I'm really glad that snack foods are starting to feature these more. The apple taste is faint but you definitely get it as soon as the almonds hit your tongue, and the red peppers...something that I've actually never had in my life, aren't strong at all. That was my only real concern with this snack when I was opening it. Despite my heritage, I've never had any kind of spicy foods, but I bit the bullet and I absolutely love these.<br /><br />As usual with great snacks, the only bad thing is the price, but Amazon has a pretty good deal on them. While 'soledad' might mean 'loneliness' in Spanish, you'll be able to overcome that feeling as long as you've got a pack of these babies around.

Graham bread, the progenitor of Graham crackers, was made from whole wheat flour...unlike that other, sinful bread.  Graham promised that following his diet would solve a wide variety of disorders, including indigestion, headache, spinal diseases, epilepsy, and insanity. The diet wasn't for everybody - virginity until age 30 was also a requirement.  Still, good old Graham wasn't too far off the mark. He advocated brushing teeth daily, drinking clean water, regular bathing, exercise, and (GASP!) a good night's rest.<br /><br />I feel healthy (and more virtuous!) every time I bite into one of these delightfully pure snacks.

Overall though, I like the Cranberry Almond the best and repeatedly go back to it as a staple for those times I skipped breakfast, need a snack, I'm on the road, etc. The Madagascar Vanilla is very good as is the Pomegranate Blueberry.

I have to say that I haven't been disappointed. The cups contain a blend of arabica and kona coffee.  They brew with a nice aroma and color.  I would describe them as a medium roast with a medium strength.  Depending on your mood you can adjust the strength by adjusting the cup size and changing your creamer.  I've had success using whole milk, half and half, and light cream, with light cream being the best in my opinion.  The taste is mellow and very smooth.  I have read other reviews here that have described them as weak or tasteless.  This is simply not the case.  I would compare it to the coffee from Dunkin Donuts.  If you prefer your coffee extra bold, dark roasted, or strong (Starbucks) then you are just not going to be happy with these.  Also, if you prefer to ""double brew"" your cups to get the most for your money, you will be very disappointed.  These will brew a delicious cup of coffee, but only if you use them as directed.

Socha,1,1,5,1347667200,The real thing.,"(This review is very similar to one I did for another brand.)<br /><br />Let me start by saying that, while not a snob or connoisseur, I have tried just about every method of making coffee known to humanity. Drip, perk, pump and steam espresso, Aeropress, Neopolitan, Canadian-made coffee bags, Toddy concentrate and everything but pan boiled with eggshells. I've ground my own beans and even roasted them in small quantities. (I must have been an alchemist in a previous time!) Most of my gear (La Pavoni espresso machine, Capresso pump machine, Capresso conical grinder, countless Bialetti pots, Revereware stainless drippers, etc.,) have come from fortunate thrift store finds.<br /><br />My interest in Turkish style coffee came about with the purchase (online auction-used) of an ASTOUNDING Turkish-made fully electronic, sensor controlled masterpiece of an automatic maker from Beko which is even easy to clean! It has won awards from CeBIT, the world's largest and most international computer expo. Atat&uuml;rk would be proud!<br /><br />I found that my grinder could produce very close to the powder-like nature of ground Turkish coffee. But I wanted to try ""the real thing,"" so I ordered this brand and another. This brand is from Turkey and comes in an attractive almost collectable metal can.<br /><br />My biggest surprise was that the coffee is not as dark roasted as what I had used before. But very pleasant with (traditionally) sugar or without.<br /><br />If you have a local coffee supplier with the gear to REALLY grind down to Turkish style, you are in luck. If not, give this a try. Standard stove-top boiler pots are cheap, but the Bekos are not. As all coffee tends to come from the same sources, I suspect I will be able to find similar quality locally, grind it or have it ground, and store it in this can.  Makes it easy to spot the Turkish grind!"

There also was none of that wonderful coffee aroma that you get with a good coffee.<br /><br />To make matters worse, there are no instructions on the box to tell you how much to use.

This really is so yummers with a bit of raw honey. The aroma is heavenly too! The ginger/citrus flavor is very comforting.<br /><br />From Celestial Seasoning's website:<br /><br />About the Tea<br />A traditional ginger tea with a tranquil twist from chamomile, eleuthero and B-vitamins.<br />100% Natural<br />This product contains all-natural herbs and flavors, and no artificial colors or preservatives.<br /><br />Ingredients: Eleuthero, peppermint, cinnamon, ginger, chamomile, West Indian lemongrass, licorice, catnip, tilia flowers, natural lemon flavor with other natural flavors (contains soy lecithin), hops and Vitamins B6 and B12.<br />------<br /><br />A little fascinating tidbits about ""eleuthero"" I found on the net:<br /><br />The constituents in eleuthero that have been most studied are the eleutherosides. Seven primary eleutherosides have been identified, with most of the research attention focusing on eleutherosides B and E. Eleuthero also contains complex polysaccharides (complex sugar molecules). These constituents may play a critical role in eleuthero's ability to support immune function.<br /><br />Eleuthero is an ""adaptogen"" (an agent that helps the body adapt to stress). It is thought to help support adrenal gland function when the body is challenged by stress.<br /><br />Eleuthero has been shown to enhance mental acuity and physical endurance without the letdown that comes with caffeinated products. Research has shown that eleuthero improves the use of oxygen by the exercising muscle. This means that a person is able to maintain aerobic exercise longer and recover from workouts more quickly. Preliminary research from Russia indicates it may be effective for this purpose. Other trials have been inconclusive or have shown no beneficial effect.<br /><br />Eleuthero may also support the body by helping the liver detoxify harmful toxins. It has shown a protective action in animal studies against chemicals such as ethanol, sodium barbital, tetanus toxoid, and chemotherapeutic agents. According to a test tube study eleuthero also helps protect the body during radiation exposure. Preliminary research in Russia has suggested that eleuthero may help alleviate side effects and help the bone marrow recover more quickly in people undergoing chemotherapy and radiation therapy for cancer.<br /><br />Eleuthero has been shown to be effective as a treatment for the common cold when combined with andrographis in a formula sometimes referred to as Kan Jang. Preliminary evidence also suggests that eleuthero may prove valuable in the long-term management of various diseases of the immune system, including HIV infection and chronic fatigue syndrome. Healthy people taking 2 teaspoons (10 ml) of tincture three times daily have been shown to have increased numbers of the immune cells (T4 lymphocytes) that have been found to decrease during HIV-infection and AIDS. Further human clinical trials are needed to confirm that eleuthero may be helpful for this disease.<br />How to Use It<br /><br />Dried, powdered root and rhizomes, 2 to 3 grams per day, are commonly used. Alternatively, 300 to 400 mg per day of concentrated solid extract standardized on eleutherosides B and E can be used, as can alcohol-based extracts, 8 to 10 ml in two to three divided dosages. Kan Jang is a formula combining an andrographis extract with an eleuthero extract providing 2 to 2.4 mg eleutherosides daily. Historically, eleuthero is taken continuously for six to eight weeks, followed by a one- to two-week break before resuming.<br /><br />Kinda cool, eh? :)"

I particularly loved his remark about cat owners being ""a little more illogical"" than other pet owners, therefore they are more likely to spend money for premium products - I resemble that remark.)<br /><br />Yes, the cat food is produced in Thailand, but it is not associated with any of the companies involved in recalls for Thailand or China, and is not on any of the FDA's lists.

You can drink your fill of Crystal Light every day and consume less than one tenth of the calories you would drinking either juice or soda, making it probably the most effective way ever to cut calories. If you drank about 2 liters of Crystal Light every day, according to the nutrition information, you would consume 5 calories for every serving of 8 fl. oz. Since there are about 33.814 fl oz./liter, 2 liters would net you 42 calories (the way I mix it with extra flavor would probably be about 55 or 60 calories a day), which is still great when you consider that the average man just cut more than 100 calories a day from his diet. Sugar drinks represent at least 6% of the average Americans caloric intake. To put it in perspective, the average 2 liter bottle of soda is between 800 and 1000 calories (kcal). Cutting that alone will result in noticeable weight loss over the long-term.<br /><br />  SAVE MONEY:<br />  - Volume wise, you will save an exorbitant amount of money switching to Crystal Light from either soda  or juice. Just replacing soda at anywhere between $.49 and $1.00/liter (if you're buying in bulk, not including purchases from vending machines, restaurants, etc...) with Crystal Light at a max of $.30/liter (depends how you mix the beverage; i like a lot of flavor) will save the average person in the U.S. (consumed 219 liters of soft drinks/yr (2002)) from $41.61 and $218.70. That isn't even including the money that would be saved by also removing other sugar-based beverages from the diet, like juice or other fruit drinks. Don't even get me started on beer, wine, wine coolers, etc... and the cost difference.<br /><br />  TASTES DELICIOUS:<br />  - Ok, I'm not going to lie.

It is great to be able to slowly pour the plastic tubes of powder, rather than the tubs, which exploded in a cloud of pink powder all over my face every time I tried to add them. They also easier to open, especially for those of use who don't have fingernails to peal those pesky, foil wrappings off.<br /><br />Cons:<br />  ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERS:<br />  - You definitely take a risk consuming non-sugar beverages that still taste sweet and delicious. No one really knows how these type of drinks will affect human physiology in the long term. Obviously the healthiest alternative to drinking sugar-engorged beverages like cola and strawberry daiquiris would be to just drink water, but we all know that NO ONE REALLY WANTS TO DO THAT. DUH!<br /><br />  STAINS:<br />  - The red, colored drinks stain everything. They will stain the hell out of your hands bright red, and every passerby will ask you why it looks like you just fought the battle of Persepolis. Don't get it on your clothes. It is even hard to get the stain off counter-tops and tables. Don't be a KLUTZ!"

Even worse than that is occasionally the cookies were pretty bland tasting. I don't know if I got a bad batch or if it's just me, but these just didn't have a lot of flavor. (However, the blueberry ones I also got to try had a lot of flavor, so it's possible I just got an underseasoned batch.)<br /><br />These weren't horrible, but I don't think I'll be putting my own money towards this flavor anytime soon. When the cookies had a flavor I could taste, they were pretty good. It's just that these were sort of bland tasting that makes me not really like them as much.

I added some chopped cabbage once and it was great.

The ""everlasting"" treats that come with the ball were okay, but when they were in the ball she would lose interest because they were just too difficult to make any headway on, and when they were outside the ball she'd just chew them up in a matter of minutes.<br /><br />The real fun is putting small treats inside it (I use Charlee Bear brand turkey liver and cranberry treats which are about the size of a lima bean) and watching her go.<br /><br />There are several ways to get at them, she's discovered - rolling by poking it with her nose will sometimes yield results - smacking it with her paw is also sometimes lucky - and squeezing it with her jaws, which she can _barely_ do.

If you're sensitive to spicy food, this probably isn't for you.<br /><br />Each package yields enough pepperoni slices to populate roughly two 12"" pizzas (one if you really want to pile on the toppings)."
266079,B001E96JZG,A3M8R4JD1SIS76,"'MaryLou Cheatham ""The Collard Patch""",0,0,4,1226966400,Good with a Little Help from Our Emergency Kit,"We enjoyed Healthy Choice Fresh Mixers, Zita & Meat Sauce.  My friend and I are spicemouths, and we found the mixers decently flavored, perhaps better than some dishes we've tried in Italian restaurants that needed to fire their cooks.  We eat in many different restaurants throughout the United States to evaluate the food.  What we have discovered is that mediocre food can be made tasty if we apply our emergency taste-enhancer kit.  Actually this dish was better than mediocre; in fact it was tasty, especially after we added some items from the kit. (We keep an array of items in our glove compartments of our vehicles and on our breakfast bar.) Realizing that we did not want to alter the calorie-count too much, we added a tiny shake of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001C5Z23M"">Kraft Grated Parmesan Cheese - 4.5 lb. container</a>, which was about 10 calories.  When we eat pasta, we like a little cheese. Then, being the way we are -- Louisiana and Texas people -- we needed a little kick.  We shook on a few flakes of crushed red.  (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F0Z0T6"">Tone's Spices Red Pepper Crushed (13.5 oz) - Large Restaurant / Food Service Size Shaker Container - Best Value per Ounce</a>-- we really do buy the large restaurant shaker, but we carry a smaller version around with us in the car.)  That's all we added, although we do have other items in our emergency supplies.  With those two little items, the ziti and meat sauce tasted good.<br /><br />Preparing it was fun.  The cute little container with the strainer lid amused me.  I thought I would wash it and reuse it, but I was amazed to discover it was engineered for single use.<br /><br />This meal of 340 calories was satisfying and handled our hunger efficiently.  It contains 600 mg sodium, which is perhaps a little less than some prepared dishes.  I was surprised to see that it contains 990 mg potassium.  People with renal disease should probably avoid this product unless they have the approval of their physician or registered dietician. There are 6 grams of total fat and 56 carb grams. With 8 grams of dietary fiber, it should get an approving nod from Weight Watchers. It meets the criteria established by the American Heart Association.<br /><br />I would recommend this dish for anyone who needs to take lunch to work where there is no refrigerator but where there is a microwave oven.  I thought we would eat it again soon, but weeks have passed and we are still thinking about it.<br /><br />Mostly recommended.<br /><br />Mary Lou Cheatham, co-author of THE COLLARD PATCH/<br />Author of FLAVORED WITH LOVE, SOLOMON'S PORCH,<br />DO YOU KNOW HOW GOD LOVES YOU?"

They were creeping / had buried roots growing horizontally, which can complicate killing them. To get rid of them, I cut the upward=growing vines about half a foot above the ground. I did this so that if I had to apply the product again, I would have enough vine remaining to cut again. Sometimes if the vine (or root or base of tree or shrub) is really thick, it can take more than one application. (It's best to apply the product to a fresh cut.) In order to apply it twice or three times, you want to leave enough length so that you can make the cut again. This stuff is strong, so don't get me wrong. But, for really large diameters, leave yourself some extra in case you have to come back.<br /><br />I've used this on oak trees too. Just cut the sapling down to size and spritz the stub. If anything grows back, you can spray the leaves or make a fresh cut. Eventually when enough of the root is destroyed, it will not grow back.<br /><br />Great product. Would buy again."

We usually make drip coffee, so maybe next time I'll just try stuffing a bunch of the coffee bags into the coffee maker.  I see the Amazon page says &lt;&lt;For Use only in Single Serve Home Coffee Pod Brewers>>.  I guess my problem is I have never heard of a Coffee Pod Brewer.<br /><br />FOLLOW-UP:  Today I put 8 of the pods in my drip pot and made 8 cups' worth and it was very good.  I called it chocolaty before, but maybe it's more like a mild cocoa flavor, slightly almond.  Very smooth and not at all bitter.  Great!"

Golden Retriever who has some weight issues and Boston, a 35 lib mixed breed who has some dental issues.  I offered the treats, both testers took them readily.  Boston retired to a comfortable spot and began to chew quite eagerly.  Hunter took the entire stick into his mouth which caused me some concern that he would choke on it.  I ordered him to drop the stick, which luckily he did.  I gave him back the stick but held on to one end so he could not take the whole thing in his mouth again. I kept hold of the (now slimy) stick until Hunter chewed off a couple appropriate size chunks.  Once the pieces were a safer size I let him enjoy, which he definitely did.  Boston, meanwhile, was holding the stick between his paws and chewing on it, taking off bite size pieces.  I had no concerns about how he was managing the product.  Both dogs were quite interesting in repeating the test.<br /><br />I offered the product again the following day.  Both dogs were quite eager.  Again Boston had no problem managing the product in a safe manner.  I gave Hunter the stick but retained control of one end so he could not gulp it whole.  He began to chew off a piece, and did eat the product safely.  I inspected Boston's teeth after he finished his portion and was pleased that there seemed to be some lessening in the tarter buildup on the back teeth.<br /><br />Both of my dogs liked the product, although to be fair neither is very picky.  I also offered the product to two other dogs, a 50 lib mixed breed who managed it quite readily and a 10 lb Yorkie who chewed it a bit and then buried it.  I am concerned that a larger, greedy dog like Hunter could choke on this.<br /><br />I like that the product is low calorie but I think that at nearly a dollar a stick it is a bit pricey.  I like that the sticks are hard enough to make the dogs chew.  Boston did seem to get some teeth cleaning benefits from the product.  Unfortunately due to the high price and the safety issues for Hunter I probably will not be purchasing this again."

They are crunchy chips that are not fried, and not baked, but created using heat and pressure to make them pop into being.  Since I love sweet potato chips in general, I thought I would give these a try.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed was the color.  They looked a bit lighter in color to other sweet potato chips I have tried, and I think this is due to them not being fried.  They really looked the same color as fresh, cooked sweet potatoes.  I did not notice any particular smell, other than good old sweet potatoes.  So far so good.<br /><br />In terms of taste, I thought they tasted great.  The chips were nice and crispy, with only a hint of salt, so you really got to enjoy the naturally sweet flavor.  I can really see that these will help satisfy cravings for something crunchy, something salty, something sweet, and especially something that is all three.<br /><br />The texture is definitely not that of a typical potato chip.  They are lighter, crisper, and airy, not as dense as a rice cake, but not as greasy as a typical chip.  All in all, I was really pleased with them.  Someone looking for a healthy replacement, or enjoys other veggie chip type snacks would really like these, I think.  For a die hard chip lover, these would might not satisfy you upon first taste, but give them a couple of chances; personally I loved them.<br /><br />With the snack size bag being 100 calories, I am pretty sold on these as a healthy snack alternative.

They LOVE it and will do just about anything for it, so it is a great treat to use for training.

It comes chopped/cubed.  It is extremely lightweight due to the fact there is so little moisture in the product (thus the low weights on product labels).<br /><br />Even though your dog will love liver treats, you shouldn't overfeed it.  The manufacturer recommends 1-2 cubes daily for small dogs, 2-3 cubes for medium dogs, and 3-4 cubes for large dogs.<br /><br />The largest package sizes of liver treats tend to be far more economical.

One of my all time favorite chocolate bars! :-P~,"For those of you not familiar, ""crunchie"" bars are solid honeycomb coated with a relatively thin layer of milk chocolate. Personally, I love 'em! They're one of my all time favorite chocolate bars. They're popular both in England and here in Australia where I live.<br /><br />Not much more to say except that you can buy crunchies in a variety of pack sizes (size being determined by the number of bars included), and this 12-pack is kinda mid sized. The larger sized packs generally offer better value. Although prices on Amazon do fluctuate over time, as of the time of writing, this 12-pack will wind up costing you just a fraction of a cent over $1.66 a bar. Weirdly, despite the general ""more is cheaper"" principle, currently the 6-pack offers significantly better value at under $1.40 a bar. Freaky. So it pays to be a careful shopper!<br /><br />Just don't forget that it's not like these are a health food. So please... However many you buy, enjoy in moderation! ;-)<br /><br />Theo."

Scott Pope ""Scott Pope""",31,36,1,1342310400,What Every Consumer Should Know - NOT Economical,"The taste of SodaStream diet cola does not match that of mainstream brands.  This becomes especially noticeable for frequent drinkers of Diet Coke or Diet Pepsi.  Yet that isn't the main problem with the SodaStream offering.  The truth is simply that consumers are paying way too much for C02 refills -- sixteen times (16x) too much.<br /><br />While the general idea of at-home carbonation is solid, consumers should understand that they are grossly overpaying for SodaStream carbon dioxide refills. In fact, the prices charged are sixteen times (16x) wholesale costs or many, many times more expensive than the prices a restaurant would pay. In Europe, frugal consumers are aware of such markups and actually purchase their own restaurant-sized CO2 refills. In the US, we aren't so frugal.<br /><br />Other than the outrageous costs for the CO2 refills, there are other issues with the SodaStream Fountain Jet. One is the construction quality is quite low with very thin molded plastic and little weight. Additionally, the taste of generic soda flavors do not match that of the brand name products.<br /><br />Below is the calculated cost per two liter for the output of SodaStream soda. This includes the cost of the consumables AND the equipment costs. I have used very generous assumptions, including a low discount rate (i.e. cost of money).<br /><br />Transportation costs were not factored because 1) purchases of typical groceries should more or less overlap with soft drink purchases 2) grocery delivery has long been available in many areas 3) most people live closer to a grocery store than to a home furnishings store (I walk 100 ft. for groceries and drive one mile for BB&B) 4) the reverse logistics for the CO2 refills is an extra expense for the retailer that has to be factored into its profit margin and will ultimately be borne by the consumer.<br /><br />One of the reasons Bed Bath & Beyond, Macy's and Crate and Barrel choose to carry SodaStream is that they want the consumer to make MORE FREQUENT trips to their establishments for consumables. Instead of going to such establishments once every 3 to 6 months, customers will now visit once every 1 to 2 months. That makes an enormous difference for generating impulse purchases at such retailers. One could argue then that transportation costs could increase for the individual consumer.<br /><br />Total Costs = $1.73 per Two Liter -- More Expensive Than Retail<br /><br />*Concentrate<br />Flavor cost bottle of concentrate $4.99<br />Liters of product per container 12<br />Flavor/l $0.42<br /><br />*Carbonator<br />Volume of CO2 130<br />Cost of CO2 per refill (130 liters) 29.99<br />CO2 cost per liter $0.23<br /><br />*Sodastream Equipment Costs - Amortization Per Liter<br />Equipment cost $89.00<br />Equipment life (years) 5<br />Discount rate (cost of money) 8%<br />Liters per month 10.00<br />Monthly amortized cost $1.80<br />Cost of equipment per liter $0.18<br /><br />*Water Cost with Brita Filtration<br />Municipal water costs per liter in US $0.0004<br />Brita filter three pack (454 liters of water output) $16.95<br />Brita cost per liter $0.0373<br />Water and filter costs per liter $0.0377<br />(assumes you already own Brita Pitcher so no equipment costs, just incremental filtration)<br /><br />***TOTAL COSTS PER TWO LITER = (Flavor + CO2 + Equipment + Filtered Water) * 2<br />SodaStream Total Cost Per Two Liter = $1.73<br /><br />Without filtered water:<br />SodaStream Total Cost Per Two Liter = $1.65<br /><br />*****What does CO2 Really Cost????<br /><br />THE MATH BELOW IS WHAT SODASTREAM DOESN'T WANT THE CONSUMER TO KNOW<br /><br />*Restaurant Carbonation (note distributor prices, so there is still a distributor profit)<br />weight of CO2 contents of large restaurant CO2 tank: 50 lbs<br />weight in grams: 22,680 grams of CO2<br />cost to refill - Summer 2011: $35<br /><br />CO2 grams/liter of carbonated water: 7 grams<br /><br />*Efficiency of Restaurant CO2 Carbonation<br />losses: 10%<br />available CO2 in tank (residual is required for pressure): 85%<br />net accessible CO2 of total: 77%<br />usable grams of CO2: 17,350 grams<br /><br />*Output<br />carbonated liters of water: 2,479<br />cost per liter in USD$: $0.014<br /><br />*SodaStream Output<br />SodaStream Refill: 130 liters (quoted end product)<br />Cost per refill: $30.00<br />cost per SodaStream carbonated water: $0.231<br /><br />*SodaStream Markup Economics<br />ratio of SodaStream to Restaurant prices: 16.3x<br />SodaStream inflation price over restaurant pricing: 1534%<br />math: [y/x-x] to give increase over base case restaurant pricing<br /><br />This is an incredible 1500% markup<br /><br />Pros<br />Saves plastic<br />Allows flexible mixture of flavors<br /><br />Cons<br />Cost of output is not compelling<br />Grossly inflated CO2 refill costs<br />Another store trip required for refills separate from grocery store visit<br /><br />***Disclaimer: I am an investor who has used the product multiple times.

The four cog-enhancing supp's in 5-hour energy are ""Vit. B-Complex Vitamins, NALT, L-Phenylalanine, Citicoline (CDP-Choline) and Caffeine"". ALL which can be bought cheap on here and combined at 1/5 the cost. Not to mention you can split the caff. tabs in half when you're already ""up"" and don't want to risk the anxiety that comes with a full tablet, which consists of 200mg of caffeine. Taurine, is often floated around as having an effect on cognition, but this has never been shown to be true amongst people I talk to and is more than likely added because some buff dude somewhere read something that said it helps with this and that. It does not, and you're welcomed to do your own research and call me out if you find evidence to the contrary. I gave it 2 stars because I don't ""hate it"", as it does work, but I ""don't like it"" as the cost is such a barrier for many. 2 bucks each? That's insane.<br /><br />In short, do your wallet a favor. Purchase the above 5 listed supplements and take them on an empty stomach and preferably in the morning (NALT will benefit the most from this regimen). Later in the day, you could do the same regimen except split a caff. tab in half so you're not up at 4am thinking about stuff you usually never think about. If you find that this stack is getting you too nervous and you're using it for learning tasks, add an L-theanine to the group and you should be good to go. If you're the knowledge-seeking type, you can also check out Huperzine-A, Alpha-GPC, and 5-HTP, and how they work on the dopaminergic system to see if you want to consider placing them in a rotating nootropic stack (taking them all at once would be a mistake)<br /><br />They're a business, I get it.

For our second child, we added a few more.  With the 3rd baby, we started out on the larger brands, but he wouldn't eat them.  Who can blame him!?  They're runny and lacking any flavor.  Not to mention, no matter how good sweet potatoes are, how many jars can you eat?  He gobbles up every jar of Earth's Best without any problems.  When we introduce a new flavor, he's all for it.<br /><br />I agree with other posts that some of the flavors are very runny.  We just add a few tsp. of cereal and problem solved.<br /><br />Earth's Best is more expensive.  I calculated that every 2 weeks of food costs me $15 more than buying the other brands.

122247,B004AH7BC4,A2E0WNF4ZNP0EU,Cyber Steve,3,3,5,1226620800,Great taste and texture!,"I really like these oats. I cook one cup (dry) of oats at a time, and store it in the refrigerator. It lasts me 4 or 5 days. It's great with maple syrup, honey, molasses and/or fruit. I am surprised by some of the hyperbole within the reviews of steel-cut oat products. Rolled oats and steel-cut oats are very similar, and both are delicious. Most reviewers are saying that the steel-cut oats have a better texture. Although I agree, they don't seem to appreciate the extent to which their oatmeal's texture is determined by the amounts of water (or milk) and time used to prepare it. The instructions printed on the packages of rolled oats (aka quick or instant oats) has the cook use far too much water and too little time during cooking, resulting in oatmeal with a thin or ""slimy"" consistency. By manipulating the amount of water and time used during preparation, you can get the oatmeal to have almost the exact same consistency as you would get from steel-cut oats. The texture will still be slightly different, perhaps inferior, but the difference is subtle. The taste of steel-cut oats is also similar, but slightly better. I cannot understand why so many people are raving about steel-cut oats while acting as if rolled oats are the most disgusting thing on the face of the planet. They are both very good. I think that most people would prefer steel-cut oats, however. If you like rolled oats, you will like steel-cut oats. If you don't like rolled-oats, you probably will not like steel-cut oats either."

Without looking at reviews or checking any other prices, I got it immediately because I was out of Catnip and are the proud owner of 4 felines.<br /><br />I put this on the kidders' favorite toys and pieces of kitty furniture as soon as it arrived. No one was very impressed, but I thought they just might be having an off day. I had just acquired 2 new kittens and tempers were a bit thin with some fur persons. Then I went to PetCo one afternoon and found a wonderful toy for the kitter who was most annoyed. It was a huge markdown and had a huge pad where this one could play alone (just the thing in her case). The toy even provided a small scratching area made of carboard. So I took it home and put it together for ""Miss Annoyed With The New Kittens"". Then I got the tin of Sojos organic catnip out and put it on th scratching area. Miss Annoyed usually goes ape for catnip. She likes to eat it and then enjoy the side effects of this happy candy. She went to the new  toy and was very interested in playing, but ate a mouthful of nip, shook her head and walked away. That was my clue that something was quite amiss.<br /><br />Since I needed to get these 4 guys to bond, I went back to Amazon and began looking for catnip again. I found Yeowww! catnip (in a huge tub) AND DID READ THE REVIEWS. This product got great reviews, so I ordered it immediately.

As soon as I had the tub open, I applied this catnip to the scratching area of ""Miss Annoyed's"" toy and sat back to see what would happen when I showed her the new catnip. She began to munch away and became ""Miss Agreeable.""<br /><br />Perhaps my Sojos Catnip was old or stale, but it should have been fine in its tin. But my cats just did not like it. ""The Other Brand"" made a huge impression on all of them though. So, I am leaning towards feeling that something MAY have bee Off in the Sojos that I got. Therefore, I will give it 3 stars.

Mango and Vanilla Chai, in that order. I mix mine is a shaker cup with a little mixing ball. I use Vanilla almond milk and a little agave syrup (I hate Stevia, it tastes like saccharine to me) and sometimes I throw a little extra hemp protein in, chia seeds, and flaxseed oil. I haven't bothered with a blender yet. One day, I'll put it into a blender with some fruit.<br /><br />Let's be real: this is a whole food shake with fruits, veggies, grasses, and hemp protein.

He was diagnosed at 1 year old and the vet put him on a prescription fish and sweet potato food to rule out a food allergy. It wasn't a food allergy so I went back to his regular food because of the price difference. We've had him on allergy shots ever since which successfully controlled them until we moved from NY to MN 2 years ago. The poor dog has gone through hell ever since. We even had him retested for ""MN"" allergens and he's been on the shots for a year with no improvement. As a last resort I reverted to our old vet's advice and put him on this to check for a food allergy. We were told symptoms would clear up within 2 weeks if it were a food allergy.<br /><br />Unfortunately it didn't clear up his skin, however his digestive health has been the best it's ever been. His old food made him really gassy and he burped a lot and while he was regular, he only went once a day. He's been on this new food for over 2 months and not only is he hardly gassy at all (the occasional burp), but he poops twice a day and they're healthy poops...not too soft or hard. Even though it's more expensive and didn't solve the skin issues, we'll keep him on a BB food for the rest of his life because we like that it's so healthy for him and he's got to be feeling better since he's not so bloated!<br /><br />We are, however, currently in the process of switching him over to the senior chicken and rice formula. I know senior dogs have different dietary needs than adult dogs so I want to make sure he's getting the right amount of stuff he needs and not too much of things he shouldn't be getting a lot of at his age and activity level.<br /><br />If the BB Lamb and Rice performs just as well as the fish and sweet potato then we're set."

I WOULD EAT THIS!"" No joke, there isn't a single ingredient name you won't recognize and there are no artificial preservatives (the food, in fact, contains ingredients that have never been frozen and so it is vacuum-sealed in the packaging--which incidentally makes the bag quite easy to carry). I have yet to meet a dog owner (in person!) who hasn't told me their dog eats this stuff like it's crack-cocaine!<br /><br />Since it is a little pricey (despite the fact that you actually have to feed your dog LESS food than any other brand with a high grain content--which is used as a filler in all your standard grocery-store dog foods because corn is so cheap), I do a half-and-half mix of Orijen with another incredible dry dog food called ""Taste of the Wild"".<br /><br />All I can say is that my Siberian Husky LOVES this food so much that when she's done she just sits there looking at me for a minute before letting out a very satisfying belch. I swear I laugh every time she does it. Finally, I can also say, and this is only anecdotal, but after I switched to this food (I was formerly feeding her Eukanuba) my dog's shedding decreased significantly. Husky's usually ""blow their coat"" once or twice a year with mild/standard shedding in-between; it was this mild/standard shedding that decreased.<br /><br />I would recommend this brand to anyone with a medium to large breed dog that has a high-energy level.<br /><br />(Edited for typos and some added content)."

Depending on size they're getting $5 to $8 US dollars for 1(yes that's one) bully stick.  And I adore the shop and their bully sticks are THE best, but really, with two pups who could easily go through 4 or more of these a week, it was too expensive.<br /><br />The ValueBull sticks are therefore well priced and I intend to buy more.<br /><br />WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW:<br />--I haven't discovered a downside to these bones, however, if you have a nose that's easily offended know that you should plan on giving these to your beasties outside.<br />--Dogs love the stink.

(There are sort of oval when looked at from the end)<br />--The only other difference I've noticed between what I'll call the premium-ultra stick and these (besides the thickness) is that my dogs seem to be able to pull off strips occasionally.

It may look greenish in the bottle, but on icing or fondant it has a nice warm color, not too yellow, not brassy, just really nice.<br /><br />I also like the different effects you can get through layering.  One coat produces a pearly gold shimmer, sort of like an Art Noveau enameled brooch. 2 + coats will get you a bolder solid gold look.  It's not going to come out like polished metal, but the effect is still VERY pretty and impressive.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this paint for writing or drawing on icing or fondant (you have to stroke over it repeatedly to produce crisp lines), but it's GREAT for ""highlighting"" raised areas and adding a beautiful something extra."

I had to go get the box to prove to my 13 yo son that they were gluten free. They are easy to make and easy to cut out. My 9 yo GF son had a great time making his own Christmas cookies. I told my GF friends and one of them made the pumpkin recipe on the box and raved about how her whole family loved them. They have been gluten free for 15 years and were so excited about these cookies. Another friend is using them for decorating at her daughter's December birthday party.<br /><br />I would keep the dough divided into halves or thirds and keep the unused part in the fridge while you are cutting out cookies. Also, the recipe calls for potato starch to flour the pastry sheet. (If you don't have a pastry sheet, use a GF cereal box liner. Cut it down one side and open it up. Works great, esp. if you have more than one kid making cookies.) I used corn starch and it worked fine. I also had to bake them a few minutes longer than the instructions. It says it makes 100 small cookies. That must be thumb nail size. We made about 30 normal cookie cutter size (3"" x 4"") cookies.<br /><br />This is at the top of our list for favorite GF treats.

They actually took about 10 minutes to finish one of these Zoe bones and not one dog walked away to see if the other dogs had something better.

That is, until I came across this NY Times article about the sugar they use... [...]<br /><br />From the article:<br /><br />Parents may be buying [Similac Organic] because they believe that organic is healthier, but babies may have a reason of their own for preferring Similac Organic: it is significantly sweeter than other formulas. It is the only major brand of organic formula that is sweetened with cane sugar, or sucrose, which is much sweeter than sugars used in other formulas.<br /><br />No health problems in babies have been associated with Similac Organic. But to pediatricians, there are risks in giving babies cane sugar: Sucrose can harm tooth enamel faster than other sugars; once babies get used to its sweeter taste, they might resist less sweet formulas or solid foods; and some studies suggest that they might overeat, leading to rapid weight gain in the first year, which is often a statistical predictor of childhood obesity."

A lot of commercial brands have been selling junk from the area but South America's better beans have a smooth taste with very little bitterness.  Gevalia appears to be using some of these better arabica beans from the area but honestly I wouldn't know one way or the other due to the deep, heavy chocolate flavor.  It reminds me of the days when I used to mix cocoa into my coffee cup, long before I became a coffee snob.  I would use this as a dessert coffee because the smooth chocolate flavor is quite nice; especially when cream is added to bring out the flavor.<br /><br />My only gripe is with the directions, ""1 rounded tablespoon for each six ounce cup of coffee??""  I guess you will need to do some calculating to equate to a real cup of coffee as you'll need more than 3 scoops to equal the size of that Starbucks Venti you've grown to love.

I choose organic formula primarily because I find GMO foods to be creepy and insane. There's been a lot of discussion about the toxicity of hexane, used to process the life'sDHA supplement in this formula. Since the only life'sDHA-free alternative has its own problems (alleged traces of arsenic due to brown rice syrup), there doesn't seem to be one optimal formula to go with... at least from the perspective of a natural/organic mama who can't exclusively breastfeed. What it came down to was my son's preference. He can't digest Baby's Only very well, and just doesn't seem to like it. We have had zero problems with digestion using Earth's Best, and he eagerly drinks it down! So ultimately it was kind of a no-brainer for us to stick with Earth's Best, despite the hexane controversy. I personally have a hard time believing that the process used to make the life'sDHA supplement is a considerable threat to my baby's well being and health, even if it isn't the most ideal thing in the universe (same goes for the controversy surrounding Baby's Only). The modern world provides opportunities to be exposed to toxins around every corner, and I'd probably be more concerned about the lack of a viable alternative if this were something my kiddo had to eat for the rest of his life.

55587,B004CYLW7A,ACHTDPEQYSEQL,mhnstr,0,1,3,1309996800,Very Sweet Cereal,"My first impression of the Crunchy Nut cereal was how sweet the cereal is.  Eating the Crunchy Nut cereal was like eating Fruit Loops or another sweetened cereal.  A look the ingredients revealed that sugar is the second ingredient after yellow corn meal, resulting in the very sweet taste.  The cereal also has a definite aftertaste of nuts which is pleasant.<br /><br />It is my belief that Kellogg's produced the Crunchy Nut cereal to compete against Honey Nut Cheerios and so I will be comparing the two cereals in my review.  I found that the Crunchy Nut O's were bigger than Cheerios and rougher.  The rough O's tended to irritate the roof of my mouth when I ate the cereal.<br /><br />A comparison of the nutrition information of the two cereals suggests that although neither cereal is really healthy due to the high sugar content, Crunchy Nut is actually better for you than Honey Nut Cheerios in terms of the sodium and calories.  However, this does not take into account that Honey Nut Cheerios is made from whole grain oats whereas Crunchy Nut is made from corn meal.  Surprisingly, Crunchy Nut actually has the same dietary fiber as Honey Nut Cheerios.<br /><br />Of the two cereals, I preferred Honey Nut Cheerios due to its slightly less sweet taste and since the Cheerios did not tend to irritate the roof of my mouth.  Overall, Crunchy Nut is not a cereal that I can recommend to people who do not like sweetened cereals or who are looking for a healthy cereal."

There is nothing in the world like a peanut butter and grape jelly sandwich on soft bread, washed down with a tall cold glass of milk.  Another favorite is celery sticks loaded with peanut butter.  How about an apple cut into crisp slices and dipped into peanut butter?  Or homemade peanut butter cookies?

The list goes on and on -<br /><br />Planters Peanut Butter is simply the best I have ever had -- and I mean the best and creamiest peanut butter.

Your bread will not tear while you are spreading it on thickly.  The taste is so full of peanut goodness and flavor.  The smell?  Divine!<br /><br />The packaging is bright and eye-catching, with good old Mr. Peanut tipping his hat to you.  By the way, Mr. Peanut was created by a grade school boy, Antonio Gentile, in 1916.  He has been changed and updated over the years, but is still the same and easy to recognize peanut he has been for all these years.  Planters was established in the early 1900's by an Italian immigrant, Amedeo Obici, in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania.  The company and their products have been around all this time due to their excellent and quality products.<br /><br />I had my 30 year old daughter blind taste test for me today.

Compared with other chutney brands, I find Patak's offers a bolder taste that is both spicy and salty.<br /><br />We buy Sweet Mango Chutney for the entire family because Patak's rates this blend at two chilies on a five-chili scale. Our sons, ages 7 and 5, have no trouble enjoying the chutney. I like hotter chutney as well but don't want to use up the refrigerator space by storing multiple jars.<br /><br />Chutneys - derived from the Hindu word chatni - have many variations and can range from sweet, sour, hot or mild. Chutney consists of fruits, vegetables or a combination of both that is reduced to a pulp that is roasted or simmered and flavored with spices, sugar and vinegar.<br /><br />Patak's Sweet Mango Chutney blends juicy mangoes with authentic spices and is served as a condiment to a curry but is also delicious on sandwiches (especially turkey, so keep it handy after Thanksgiving!) and hot salads.<br /><br />Aida Mollenkamp at Chow offers this recipe for Cheddar and Chutney Tea Sandwiches.<br /><br />TIME/SERVINGS<br />Total: 35 mins<br />Active: 5 mins<br />Makes: 8 tea sandwiches<br /><br />The question is not whether cheese and chutney go well together, but rather which cheese to choose. As a nod to the British, we've opted for an aged sharp cheddar to star in this sandwich, but snacking in the test kitchen revealed that fresh goat cheese is a close runner-up.<br /><br />Game plan: Let the sandwiches rest at room temperature for 30 minutes before serving, so the chutney has time to soak into the bread.<br /><br />INGREDIENTS<br />8 tablespoons mango chutney<br />16 slices (2-1/2-by-2-1/2-inch) dark pumpernickel cocktail bread<br />4 ounces aged sharp cheddar, thinly sliced<br /><br />INSTRUCTIONS<br />Spread a thin layer of chutney on one side of each bread slice. (You will use 1 tablespoon per sandwich or 1 1/2 teaspoons [1/2 tablespoon] per slice of bread.)<br /><br />Top 8 slices with a layer of cheese (about 1/2 ounce per slice) and close sandwiches with remaining 8 slices of bread. Let sit about 30 minutes before serving to allow flavors to meld. Serve sandwiches whole, or if you like, slice each sandwich in half on the diagonal.<br /><br />Here's another delicious chutney recipe I found online:<br /><br />Chutney-Glazed Cheese Pate<br /><br />6 oz. cream cheese, softened<br />4 oz. sharp Cheddar cheese, shredded<br />3 tablespoons dry Sherry<br />3/4 teaspoon curry powder<br />1/4 teaspoon salt<br />2 green onions, finely sliced (optional)<br />Mango chutney<br /><br />Process the first five ingredients using a food processor until well blended.

This is the best dog food peroid.,"After Purina changed the formula for the dog food that my pooch was able to eat by adding in processed chicken I had to start looking for another alternative. She has allergies and she's older. The Purina food for seniors was originally lamb and rice and seemed to do her just fine. Chicken does not agree with her though.<br /><br />It was a decision of mine to go for the best since she is approached 12. I found this food at Whole Foods originally and purchased a 5 pound bag for a little over $20. There was a noticeable difference immediately with my dog. First of all she loved it. First bowl and went to town. Within 24 hours I noticed that the stools she was producing were more moist and of a better color with less smell. Then after just a few days her coat started to shine in a way that I had not seen in a while. She always has had a shine to her coat but this brought her coat back to a luster I had not seen since her youth. Makes me regret the years I spent feeding her the other food but since she never developed any health issues it did not seem to be a problem.<br /><br />Very happy I had happened upon this natural food for her. The only downside of course was trying to find this on Amazon via a direct search (maybe because of the forward slash symbol) or anywhere else on the web besides C & P's website where the 15 pound bag sells for $60, and that option of size is not available in any pet store around where I live. The way I found it which is most likely how you have found it was by doing a search for the UPC number of the food itself and finally it populated a link for this size bag on Amazon. 15 pounds is the largest size offered so far by C & P btw.<br /><br />Cost wise I do not mind spending the $46 for my dog and she is 35 pounds so this bag should last at least a month or month and half. Worth every penny to make her happy and healthy.<br /><br />Highly recommend."

This particular Starbuck's blend is awful to say the least.  I knew it wasn't going to end well when I opened the bag and was nearly overcome by the nasty aroma.  To me, coffee is supposed to smell good as well as taste good.<br /><br />I decided that maybe my nose was deceiving me.  So I brewed a couple of cups worth (I make my coffee at night for the next day) and waited thinking that perhaps it would taste better than it smelled.  Once it finished brewing, I took a sip of it black.  UGH!  I thought maybe sugar will help.  NOPE.  My next trick was to add vanilla flavored creamer.  NADDA!<br /><br />It seems as if this is a smokey blend.  The taste is very heavy and not at all appealing to me.  I think I expected a lighter, smoke free and perhaps more tangy flavor.<br /><br />Now I have to try to give this away....(sigh)"

The flavor is pleasant and mild, not as strong as I like it, but good nonetheless. I ordered this City Roast to compensate for the milder flavor, but it isn't very dark. One reviewer said the beans were dark and oily, but the ones I got are just a little darker than non-dark-roast beans, with just a smidgen more sheen on them. They don't stick together in clumps at all like a French roast. And the flavor is just a little bit ""darker"" than regular beans (such as Dunkin' Donuts original). I found no downsides to the flavor (no bitterness, ""dustiness,"" or ""chemical"" aspects), but I just wish it was stronger. If you prefer a medium-mild flavor with just a hint of darkness, this is a good choice. (But the review that said the beans were oily suggests that the roasting might be a little inconsistent.) I liked it better than their Dark Brazilian, which also wasn't very dark, and which wasn't as pleasant overall."

When it is done brewing, pour it over ice and be sure to squeeze in a little lemon which rounds out the flavors - it makes it the perfect beverage.  The fact that it is healthy is just a bonus!!

I find it to be a perfect serving for one person, probably 'cos I am of East Indian origin and rice is a staple for us. It is very convenient and not too expensive either. Especially if you compare it with Annie Chun's sticky rice. It doesn't taste like rice you have made in a rice cooker or in a pot on the stovetop, it tastes like rice made instantly in the microwave. The texture is somewhere between that of sticky rice and regular rice. The only thing I don't like is the plastic bowl it comes in, for two reasons: 1. you can ""taste the plastic sometimes, especially at the bottom and the sides. 2. it goes straight into the landfill. It would be great if they replace the plastic bowl with some sort of natural/biodegradable material. That's the reason I took off one star, otherwise it is a pretty good product for the price. If you are getting it this rice, I'd  suggest doing what I do and what some others here have said, dump the contents in a creamic/glass bowl and follow the instructions on the package to microwave.

Sigh,"Unfortunately, I can't afford a raw food diet for my cats and they want nothing to do with Felidae, the only affordable truly healthy food that has an ingredients list that makes me feel comfortable. My cats love both turkey formulas of Newman's brand. I always have dry food available which they like but they become vocal to be feed this stuff, they are Siamese so I must do their bidding or the racket doesn't end. I always smell the open product and for six months now, no irregular smells or coloring.<br /><br />Concerns are the fillers that I see in the ingredients, brown rice and oat bran are better than wheat and corn I agree, but it still irks me that a company makes such a commitment to be organic and then uses fillers. Also, Guar Gum makes me a little nervous, though guar gum is one of those fibers that are everywhere, it is basically a thickening agent (think cornstarch) and like any fiber it has its positives along with its negatives. A plus for this brand is that its carried in my local supermarket which is very practical and the price I find reasonable for an organic brand.<br /><br />Since I don't want them to become dependent on any single brand I also feed them Natural Life (same filler issues) which they like but don't love as much as Newman's Turkey flavors.

I have two kitties and one was 3 mo and one 9 mo when I first began ordering this for them. The 9 month old was already a wet food eater, but the little 3 month old had lived in a rescue situation most of her life and was only familiar with kibble. The older kitten began to gobble it up immediately. The little female was not so sure what this stuff was. The first night she had it, she had two or three bites and went back to her kibble. But she soon learned that life was better with a mixture and she began to eat the Turkey also. I could have stayed with the less expensive kibble, but I feed wet food because I want the male to get all the fluid in him that he can to avoid urinary tract problems. So I feed wet and dry.<br />This food lasts for a long time. Both of my kitties are ""free feeders."" Their wet food is put out and left for 24 hours until the next day when two new cans magically appear for them. The kibble is always available. The get to go outside a little while each day while I watch them, and we play with Da Bird and other toys almost daily. So, even if food is out, they stay trim. But the food stays good for longer than 24 hours. They eat all they want and then I leave left over wet and some dry food for the ferals who live around in the back yard. The ferals eat the Turkey after it is 24 hours old and they do not turn up their noses. When they are through, the birds come in and finish the plate.<br />It is now July 2011 and the kitties still eat the Turkey Tuscany. They don't get it every night, but they do get it about once a week. It has remained a mainstay of their diet while other things have come and gone.<br />So I am really pleased with the Turkey Tuscany. My kitties eat abot 7/8 of a can and leave a few bites for the ferals who gobble it down with their dry food. With my kitties, the feral kitties, and then the birds finishing up any stray bite, it certainly never goes to waste. I recommend it highly as it has a long lasting tradition of being well eaten at my house."

I saw a box in a store recently for $12.99, but when I buy six boxes at a time, it's about $8 on Amazon for 80 teabags.  The boxes keep well, with no loss in taste.

I actually end up getting more out of the Mio than a case of Snapple simply because I can control how much I want to drink in one serving whereas sometimes I end up throwing half a Snapple away.  I haven't noticed any chemical taste or smell like some of the other reviews.  It's also great how this Mio has no calories or sugar so I love it when I need a water replacement.

I immediately put them in the freezer except for the current 12 I'm using. I drink about 3 cups a day, and keep the open k-cups in a sealed plastic bag on a shelf. Quality has not degraded to a point where I've even noticed.<br /><br />A few notes:<br />- This is apparently the same bean mix they use in Fog Chaser, but it clearly is a lighter roast. I find it suits my taste preferences better than Fog Chaser, and my understanding is that a lighter roast means more caffeine.<br />- A normal k-cup has a plastic base, the filter basket with the grounds, a plastic ring to hold the basket in place, and a metal foil seal. These are significantly cheaper in part because they don't have that cup. This leads to my storing the 12-packs in the freezer until I need them. I would suggest trying the ones with the full cup first to figure out if this (or Fog Chaser) can be your regular coffee, and if so, definitely get these.<br />- One issue that I don't care about, but others do, is that the cup isn't there to catch the really fine grounds. You will end up with some grounds at the bottom of your cup. If that bugs you, don't get these. The grounds are very fine and don't affect the taste of the coffee.<br /><br />Oh, the taste: it's a medium roast perhaps on the lighter side of the spectrum. If you like a darker roast (e.g., that popular coffee chain that burns their beans to ashes, IMHO),  then you'll like Fog Chaser more probably. The acidity and bitterness are well-balanced. I drink my coffee straight black, which is how I like it; if I kept the same taste but switched to cream and/or sugar, I would go with Fog Chaser. The thing I like about this blend/roast is that it has excellent flavor with a hint of nuttiness. It doesn't have a ton of body, IMHO, but that's just what I've found to be the case with the Keurig. I'm thinking about the K2, but I'll wait for more pod choices.<br /><br />Finally, I'll be honest, I don't buy these for eco reasons; I'm too picky about my coffee. However, there is less waste and, if I was the sort of person to compost, it would be very easy to separate the basket from the ring and compost the grounds."

We called it ""Icky Stik"" or ""Stinky Stik""","As much as our dogs enjoyed Lickety Stik, the cloying stench of ""savory chicken"" repulsed the rest of the family. The odor wafted off the stick and filled the room like a musky air freshener. We called it ""Icky Stik"" or ""Stinky Stik"" as the experience was so nauseating that no one volunteered to reopen the stick, despite pleas from our dogs.<br /><br />We tested the PetSafe Lickety Stik as part of the Amazon Vine program, which is to say the product arrived free. The company sent us the Savory Chicken flavor and we tested it with our Cockapoo and Miniature Schnauzer, both adult females. Neither dog had trouble figuring out how to advance the roller ball so they could taste the liquid. One warning: if you get this stuff on your hands you'll play heck trying to wash it off.<br /><br />A collective shudder ran through the family as we wondered: if Savory Chicken smells this bad, can you imagine inhaling a deep whiff of ""Braised Liver"" or ""Smoky Bacon""? Worse yet, the company touts the product's portability and recommends carrying it in your purse. That's a bit risk since this stuff in the bottle is hardly perfume.<br /><br />The company says Lickety Stick consists of all-natural ingredients. Here's the list from the bottle: Natural Chicken Flavors, Cultured Milk Lecithin, Mixed Tocopherois (Natural Preservative - A Source of Vitamin E), Ascorbyl Palmtate (Source of Vitamin C), Rosemary Extract, Green Tea Extract.<br /><br />In summary, with so many better options available for dog treats, we cannot recommend Lickety Stick because of its foul smell, sticky ingredients and the serious risk to your purse should the bottle leak.<br /><br />Rating: One star."

We had 3 flavors of Stiks, Bacon, Chicken and Liver.  We tried all three on both Sundae and Casey.  Sundae licked all three and seemed to like them all. Casey, however, wouldn't try any of the three, just turning his head in apparent disgust (lol).  Having had dogs my whole life, you never can tell what a dog will like or dislike.  I didn't give this 5 stars, because of some functional reasons, not because Casey didn't even try it.  First, the lick ball is exactly like a deodorant ball. As a matter of fact, the container reminds me of an Arrid Rollerball Deodorant bottle exactly.  It doesn't move freely by just licking, you have to gently squeeze the bottle for the liquid to be available to the dog.  If you squeeze too hard, it drips onto the floor.

I find that the beverage's bitterness is offset by the sugar content.  And strong, in that I began to feel a caffeine buzz within minutes after drinking less than 1/3 of the can (on an empty stomach), and after finishing the can I felt a significant caffeine buzz comparable to what I feel after drinking an 8 ounce can of Red Bull. But I would say that the buzz I got from the illy was smoother than what I typically experience on the relatively rare occasions (usually during long drives) when I partake of Red Bull, in the sense that the illy gave me a buzz without any jittery feeling, and I did not experience the kind of ""come down"" that I have experienced after drinking Red Bull.<br /><br />It says, ""VERY LOW SODIUM"" on the illy caffe label (20mg per can), and that's good for those of us who watch our sodium intake.<br /><br />illy issimo caffe is a product of Denmark and is produced for and distributed by the Coca-Cola Company. Each 6.8 ounce can contains 155mg of caffeine, nearly double the 80mg of caffeine found in each 8.5 ounce can of Red Bull. At the Coffee Chemistry dot com page titled, ""Caffeine content in espresso vs drip coffee"" we are told that, ""According to the National Coffee Association (NCA) a typical cup of drip coffee (8oz) contains approximately 65-120 mg of caffeine."" A 12 ounce can of Coca Cola has less than 40mg of caffeine, so the bottom line is that there is a lot of caffeine in each 6.8 ounce can of illy issimo caffe compared to what we find in other commonly consumed caffeinated beverages. A shot of espresso has 30-50mg of caffeine, so to get the amount of caffeine in a can of illy issimo caffe one would have to drink about 3-5 shots of regular espresso.<br /><br />If you're in the market for a strong coffee/espresso beverage in a can that's meant to be drunk cold and that can give you a good caffeine pick-up, give illy issimo caffe a try."

I was introduced to it four years ago, through a local celiac support group.  It is a cup-for-cup replacement for all-purpose flour in your own favorite recipes.  You can even use it to make a roux.  In some recipes, I find it best to add a tad more flour or a tad more liquid -- but I can tell whether I need more of either as I am mixing the ingredients.  And, with some recipes, I do need to increase the baking time as gluten-free flours do tend to take longer to bake.  I use it for cakes, cookies, muffins, bread and breading for fried foods, pie crusts and other pastries, gravies and roux, waffles, whatever.  I have noticed that foods fried with Domata Living Flour do not absorb as much oil as foods fried with all-purpose wheat flour, so they are crisper and they reheat well without turning soggy.  I don't need extra gluten for pie crusts, but you can add a tad more xanthan gum if you find that it is not quite stretchy enough for your pastry recipes.  The taste and texture are equal to all-purpose wheat flour.  Baked goods may not rise quite as much as with a wheat flour, but I find that the cakes and muffins are still the same size as they were when I made them with all-purpose wheat flour.  I have shared this with many celiacs or those who cook for celiacs, and it has been a hit with each and every one.  One note:  if you are using an old bread recipe, remember that gluten-free dough has no gluten to be developed by kneading and does not benefit from the second rise that some recipes include.  You can do either without harm, but there is no advantage to doing so.<br />This is the one gluten-free flour I must have in my kitchen."

It's supposed to be mango peach and honestly it didn't taste like either of those things.  The suggested serving is 1 squeeze per 8oz serving so I tried that at first in my water bottle.  It tasted like extremely watered down indeterminate flavored gatorade.  Not so good.  So the next time I amped it up and did 3-4 squeezes into my water bottle.  This time the flavor was stronger but it still didn't taste a thing like mango or peach and actually I felt like I was drinking that sugar water they place in hummingbird feeders.  The color was about the same too come to think of it.  It was kind of disappointing not only for the taste, but for the fact that I needed to use 3x the amount suggested to actually taste anything.  This means there probably won't be the 24 servings it says it has.  Not that I'll probably finish it.<br /><br />The only thing this had going for it was that the ingredients were somewhat natural.  But then they through a bunch of red and yellow dyes to bring that down.  It also has an attractive bottle that it comes in, easy to tote around.  But that only goes so far.  This product is supposed to flavor water and since it fails in that area I can't really recommend it.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2011"

My cats did eat this food, in fact they really enjoyed it. However, after reading the ingredients and doing some research, I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my cats. The first three ingredients are (which indicates the most prevalent ingredients) are Fish, water sufficient for processing, and meat by-products. At least the first ingredient is 'fish' and not a by-product or cheap filler, but I find it odd that its not ""salmon"" or ""tuna"" just ""fish"". If they were using quality fish, they wouldn't have to hide behind an ambiguous label. Also, the rest of the ingredients are disgusting! There are many by-products in this food. By-products are not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, bones, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful cat food. I suppose you get what you pay for. I think the only reason why it was cat-approved may be because it contains artificial flavors that put off an appetizing aroma, and taste good to cats. Also, I usually feed my cats dry food for dental and digestion reasons, so I think they were excited just to have a wet food ""treat."" I recommend to stay far away from Friskies, as it is simply a marketing company with no regard for the feline diet; thus producing very low quality filler food. Even though the price is quite inexpensive, your cat will actually eat more than if you paid for a better quality food, because they will never feel full. Cats are carnivores and need to eat meat, and there just isn't enough real meat in this food. When purchasing a cat (or dog) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you can identify and would eat yourself. Now that I know what to look for, I usually buy my pets all natural foods, such as Natural Balance, Blue Buffalo, Halo, or Wellness. All of those brands contain real, whole meats that I myself would eat- with no added fillers or low quality arbitrary ""meats""."

I actually straddled her back, attempting the only thing I  knew how to do - the human Heimlich Maneuver! Like where exactly is a dog's sternum, anyway?

What is chicory? Thought you would never ask. I just happen to have that answer right here:<br />From Wikipedia: ""Root chicory (Cichorium intybus var. sativum) has been in cultivation in Europe as a coffee substitute. The roots are baked, ground, and used as a coffee substitute and additive, especially in the Mediterranean region (where the plant is native), although its use as a coffee additive is also very popular in India, parts of Southeast Asia and the American South, particularly in New Orleans. Chicory, with sugar beet and rye was used as an ingredient of the East German Mischkaffee (mixed coffee), introduced during the ""coffee crisis"" of 1976-9."" Chicory is also related to endive and raddichio.<br /><br />Cafe au lait is strong coffee mixed half with hot milk, and sugar added as desired. There is nothing like it, especially when drunk in the atmosphere of New Orleans."

I love the health benefits and this tea has actually helped me feel pretty good after drinking a cup, but the taste is becoming a bit overbearing. As I mentioned early in my review, the taste is reminiscent of pink Necco mints (minus the mint part, of course) but it can be hard for me to get through a cup of it because after awhile that Necco taste begins to remind me more and more of chalk. Yes, it definitely has a chalky flavor.

If you haven't tasted it before, I'd recommend you order a cup or try a smaller sized package because you might not like it.  It can, however, grow on you.  I like it very much; it's one of my very favorite teas.  It's quite popular in England both at breakfast and at tea time.  It is almost always available if you are out having high or afternoon tea.  It's made with black tea, so it, of course, has caffeine--though now it is available in decaf as well through Amazon etc.  This box has a large quantity of tea bags of high quality tea.  There are other brands, but Twinings is a good one (though not my very favorite, it's right up there).  Using bags is, of course, more convenient, but frankly, I prefer loose tea with which you can vary the strength as you wish.  I have friends who make it by the pot.  Those wanting weaker tea just pour it off earlier.  I like it stronger.  On the other hand, you can put a bag in a mug, stick in the microwave, and have tea in a few minutes.  Enjoy!  Hope you like the Bergamot!"

Then my supermarket started carrying PG Tips. It was a good price, so I started using it. Eventually I decided to buy bergamot oil to make my own version of Earl Grey. I bought this loose tea because I thought I could save even more money by buying tea in bulk. You get 6 8.8 ounce boxes of loose tea, and the price per ounce is way better than the supermarket price for bagged PG Tips. I think the bagged tea may be a little stronger because it is powdered.

Oh, the boxes are ""hermetically"" sealed, so to speak. There is thick foil solidly affixed to the opening under the cardboard lid, so until you peel back this foil, the tea is going to stay fresh.

I've tasted them all and while it's more bland than I had imagined, it's tasty. It's not sweet, just like a mellow oatmeal.

We recently purchased this for our 8 month old French Bulldog after our trainer suggested feeding him by hand to prevent him from gobbling up his meals in 2 seconds as Frenchies do. While that's great in theory, there are many times we just can't sit and feed him his kibble bit by bit. We tried several Kong type products and he was able to either get his food out too quickly or grew bored and never ate. This toy makes him really work for his food and because he can see the food through the tube it really keeps his interest. My only gripe is that the plastic tube could be more sturdy. I love that it's see through but his jaws of steel have already done some damage to it, but perhaps we just need to experiment with a larger size (we have the small now) We've only had it a short time so I can't speak too much for longevity but for now it is an amazing solution."

And often the package tears in such a way upon opening as to be useless afterward.<br /><br />Other Bigelow 20 count box tea that I've purchased do have individual packaging for each tea bag, so if that matters to you, choose the 20 count instead of this 40 count. The price is slightly higher, so there's a trade-off.<br /><br />The tea itself is quite a bit stronger than Twinnings. Its flavor is good, but I'm not convinced this is the best Earl Grey.

But, opinions and preferences may differ on that.<br /><br />But, here's what's really surprising about this product as compared with other p√£o de queijo mixes we've used: you have to add your own cheese to this one!  This makes for more work, increases the overall cost, and as noted above, does not (imho) result in a better product.  We wondered if it's really any different than making it from scratch then (out of manioc flour), but it is... substantially less work than making it from scratch.

Immediately, I revised our ""Subscribe And Save"" to receive this instead of what we'd used previously.  I've made converts of my sister and my mother, both of whom use this now instead of there former brands.  Everyone who tastes it loves it.<br /><br />I failed to mention that we've been using the San Francisco Bay ""frustration free packaging"" coffee for about six months -- both French Roast and Fog Lifter.  Besides the coffee being delicious, we have had absolutely no problems with our Keurig machine becoming clogged or finicky.  Prior to that, for two years, we held our breath each morning wondering if we'd have to resort to the paraphernalia of paper clips, needles, etc,. in an attempt to make a cup of coffee.  We'd even returned two brewers due to the problem.  Now... a perfect brew every time."

Unfortunately, the results were not what I expected.<br /><br />I started with the standard herb garden. All of the seed pods sprouted on schedule. One of the bulbs burned out within 2 months. Aerogrow guarantees the bulbs for six months (which, by the way is their recommended lifespan), so they sent me a new pair.<br /><br />Now on to the garden products themselves. Don't get me wrong, they all tasted the way they were supposed to, but there wasn't the intensity I would normally get from something grown in the ground. I was hoping that the nutrients that come with every kit would provide the elements needed for the flavor. They didn't.<br /><br />Since then, I've also tried the cherry tomatoes and the salad greens. In every case, even with normally tasty cherry tomatoes, there was absolutely nothing exciting about the flavor of anything I grew in the garden.<br /><br />I won't be using it anymore. I'll be better off using regular small pots and good potting soil with a little fertilizer.<br /><br />I can understand where hydroponics would be necessary and even taste good in the right situation, but using water exclusively for growing vegetables at home just doesn't do it for me."

522395,B001KUWFPC,A1HOLE9R6WPT85,Mad Max,111,130,1,1295827200,"We examined their claims, gave it a taste-test, & found multiple problems with Zevia...But here's a solution! (Read on)","First, my household is a low-carb, low-glycemic index, and zero corn syrup household. We have been looking for alternative *natural* sweeteners for quite some time because our doctor has serious warnings (and lots of research) against chemical-based sugar substitutes like aspartame, saccharine, and splenda.<br /><br />Stevia is our favorite sweetener - usually from a bottle, or as a raw leaf. The problem is, we can find very few products (like snack bars, soda, cookies, etc) which use Stevia.<br /><br />So we were excited to meet the people from Zevia at the trade show in which they rolled out this product (2007)... and we were among the first people in the country to taste a stevia-flavored soda!<br /><br />At the trade show, the company gave out mini-cans of selected flavors, and we were super impressed. The taste is different from mainstream root beer, cola, and ginger ale products ... but it was sweet, sparkly, and had a nice bite. No awful aspartame aftertaste!<br /><br />We came home excited to order our first batch for home/personal use. To our disappointment, we found several discrepancies between their product & literature at the trade show, and the actual product rolled out.<br /><br />First, they decided to add caffeine to many of the flavors (not the root beer), but this ruined most of the flavors for us & makes their ""all natural"" claim a bit disingenuous.<br /><br />Next, we were told by company reps that the soda contains only purified water, stevia, and citric acid. To our surprise, when the ingredients were published on the can (FDA standards), we found that the PRIMARY sweetener is an artificial chemical called eurethrytol (2nd ingredient), not Stevia (5th ingredient). Drinking a 12 ounce can of ginger root beer flavored Zevia had the same effect on me as eating 4 maltitol-based chocolate bars (LOTS of stomach problems).<br /><br />Finally, they claim this is a zero calorie drink, but erythritol does indeed contain calories - about 25 for the can. And at $1 per can, the price is just to high. This product was a disappointment all around.<br /><br />SOLUTION!!<br /><br />Ok, so you're wanting a safe, natural, great tasting soda without side effects? All you need are 3 ingredients: Seltzer Water, Bottle of liquid Sweet Leaf Stevia, and (secret ingredient) citric acid.<br /><br />Seltzer water is widely available at any grocery store. You'll find the other two ingredients at your health food store (we buy citric acid in the bulk section of our local apothecary, under $1 per ounce).<br /><br />For one serving of soda (12 ounce) add 15-20 drops of liquid Stevia, and just a *PINCH* (1/8th teaspoon?) of citric acid. The Stevia sweetens and flavors, and makes a very nice drink. But the citric acid adds that ""bite"" that makes a cola taste like a cola!<br /><br />Our favorite Sweet Leaf flavors are: Root Beer, Cinnamon, Orange, & Apricot. This method is actually much cheaper than cans of Zevia, tastes better, broader variety of flavors, super portable (we travel with a little pouch of citric acid & a bottle of Sweet Leaf), and it's truly natural!<br /><br />Three more notes for health-conscious people: (1) We have tried many off-brand bottles of liquid Stevia, and they are all just fine. HOWEVER, many of the off-brands use a grain alcohol base, which tastes awful in soda (unless you're used to that sort of thing! Ha Ha...). So other brands are fine for cooking, but at this time I recommend Sweet Leaf for mixing drinks (just purified Stevia + water).<br /><br />(2) Aluminum cans are a disaster for the environment (takes one 12oz can of gasoline to melt down/recycle 4 new aluminum cans). So I recommend bottles of Seltzer water instead.<br /><br />And, (3) artificial carbonation robs your body of magnesium & other things. Instead, opt for naturally sparkling water, like Pellegrino. We usually pay $1.15 for a 1-liter bottle of naturally sparkling mineral water, no additives, and it has lots of healthy minerals. GOOD LUCK in your continued journey for better health!"

We have one puppy and one senior, so both are in crucial stages. The puppy had bad dandruff and dull, course hair while the senior had various issues throughout his life including seizures and IBD. I decided to try a home cooked diet for them but after the pup developed an allergy I was scared to try anything else on my own. We decided to try Wellness after some research on the natural brands (not to mention a taste test with samples from Pet People).<br /><br />This food has done WONDERS. The pup no longer has dandruff and his coat is shiny and silky. His energy level is also through the roof. Our older dog has always been a veeery picky eater, sometimes going a couple days in between meals if it wasn't appetizing enough for him, but he loves the Wellness food and even eats it dry! No canned mix-ins necessary! Since he started eating it we haven't seen any IBD symptoms and he's acting a lot younger.<br /><br />I wholeheartedly recommend this food, or at least another brand of natural food. I encourage you to compare the ingredients in Wellness to regular food as even  ""high-end"" grocer brands (like Science Diet) contain the same junk as the generic ones!"

Generally, I prefer a lighter roast that is less bitter than regular Starbucks. The description mentioned this being a milder coffee, so I was pleased to have the opportunity to try it.<br /><br />I enjoy flavored coffees, although rarely vanilla. I usually find the vanilla to be so overpowering that it masks any taste of the coffee beneath. I was pleased to note that upon opening the bag, the vanilla smell was subtle and pleasant. So far so good. Even though I normally buy whole bean, this bag is pre-ground. I brewed it in my Bunn coffee maker, which is a drip brewer. The aroma while brewing was lovely!<br /><br />I would say that this is definitely a dark roast, although it is milder than regular Starbucks. There is still a certain degree of bitterness. The vanilla flavor is perfect - just the right amount. My husband said that adding (real) cream and a little sugar make his cup a real treat.<br /><br />This coffee would thrill regular Starbucks fans who enjoy vanilla. However, it is somewhat smoother and milder than regular Starbucks, so I think you could serve it to anyone and it would be enjoyable. (Please note, despite the vanilla flavor, it is definitely strong and has a serious caffeine punch.)"

They are vegan friendly, parve (no meat or dairy), and gluten free.<br /><br />The package says they are healthier because they are not fried and they are tastier because they are not baked.

That means you can apply it liberally and it's unlikely you will make any dish too hot. So it is user friendly.<br /><br />Ingredients (as copied from the label): Aged cayenne peppers, distilled vinegar, water, salt - etc<br /><br />Yet why have I rated it 2 stars? The simple answer it has far too much vinegar and it ends up tasting like vinegar and a bit bitter too. In addition, this sauce lacks any character beyond that heavy dose of vinegar. Now, if you happen to like a lot of vinegar in your hot sauce - then you might love this sauce and my 2 star rating is way off base. I don't like anywhere near this much vinegar. I've blind taste tested over 30 hot sauces and there are much better ones, including ones that have a fair amount of vinegar.<br /><br />What is interesting is that the original Tabasco sauce has a near identical taste to Franks once it is diluted.<br /><br />BTW: You will find mention that this sauce was top rated by Cooks Illustrated. That is absolutely true but what these pundits fail to mention is this was a casual test, done in 2005, comparing only three hot sauces!<br /><br />Suggestion: Since tastes vary and if you happen to like this sauce - then you can save a lot of money by buying it in one of its larger sizes - at least 23 oz and consider the gallon size. They don't cost much more than the smaller sizes.<br /><br />I'd encourage everyone to experiment with a sauce that is not so heavily laden with vinegar or is at least - better balanced.<br /><br />Try any of these:<br /><br />a) Huy Fong Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce - This sauce has considerable heat but it is nicely balanced against a bit of sweetness combined with a vague hint of garlic. Virtually every supermarket carries it - look in the Asian section! It has no vinegar, is considerably more potent than Franks, yet just a bit sweet. Compared to Franks you have to be careful not to add too much.<br /><br />b) Cholula Original Hot Sauce - features a fine blend of peppers - low to medium heat and readily available - look in the Mexican section. It has a hint of vinegar but is diluted, much like Franks yet with a far superior taste. Highly recommended<br /><br />c) Valentina Salsa Picante Mexican Extra Hot Sauce - a great blend with more vinegar than the above but not too much. Another great blend and not so hot that it is unforgiving.<br /><br />d) Valentina Salsa Picante Mexican Hot Sauce - a decent blend but with a lot of vinegar. Still it is much better than Franks.<br /><br />e) Tapatio Hot Salsa Picanta - another widely distributed and excellent Mexican Hot sauce. A lot of vinegar but still far less than Franks. Once again you will find this in your Mexican isle.<br /><br />In my opinion, all of the above are far superior to Franks.<br /><br />If you happen to like Franks and are at the least bit curious, you should try any of the ABOVE. For only a few bucks for a bottle, what is there to lose?<br /><br />I hope Amazon customers will rate my review after taste testing one of these other hot sauces.<br /><br />My very best<br /><br />Thanks"

They love the taste and we love them for the 'benefits'!!<br /><br />I respectfully request that Amazon and Amazon members make up their own minds, and not fall to the 'fear mongers' and ignorance amoung us.  Always supervise your dogs when giving treats - after all, they are the animals and we are supposed to be the 'smart' ones.....don't be afraid, do your homework, it always pays!"

I have an almost 2 year old chocalate lab.  When i got him from the breeder at 9 weeks he was on Eukanuba, which he stayed on with me at 1st.  After talking to a friend who breeds world class vizlas, she told me how she feeds them Canidae and how wonderful it is.  I switched over to Canidae then thank god and ever since.  My chocalate lab people actually think is a black lab.  He is the darkest chocolate lab u have ever seen, his coat is so beautiful and glossy, when he was on the eukanuba it was light brown and discolored.  Coats can be a huge problem with choc labs, but canidae has solved that problem.  With all the problems with menu foods that include so called good foods like eukanuba, science diet, iams, etc, it is a relief i can trust canidae and not be worried about all that.

These portion packs succeed in that the flavor is spot-on. They might even be better than what you'd get in a theater because the flavor is so fresh when just popped.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the flavor alone doesn't make this a great purchase. As others have mentioned, the texture of the popped corn varies widely. Of four pre-portioned packages that we've popped so far, three produced stale, chewy popcorn. When we tried the fourth batch using the packaged butter salt and coconut oil with an equivalent amount of another brand's popcorn that we had on hand, it was much more tender.<br /><br />Also, if the packs are poured directly into the kettle as intended, the resulting popcorn is almost inedibly salty. Much more palatable results were produced using about half of the packaged amount. But by the time you're customizing the pour, the 'convenience' factor of these packages is shot. Not that they're very convenient, anyway - the 4 oz. portion was very difficult to transfer into our 4 oz. kettle. The bag is very big compared to the working space inside the heated kettle elements, and it's almost impossible to make popcorn without oil, salt, and kernels falling all over the place or dripping all over the bag.<br /><br />Considering the portion issues and difficulty of use, in the future I'll be buying the three components separately. I'd stick with this company's coconut oil and butter salt, but would likely get different corn."

Were they in fact made of beef or cowboy? Since cannibalism hasn't generally been in practice for quite some time (and even when it was, only by savages of the worst sort), I felt it was quite likely that the 'beef' mentioned in the title was the meat source, but it wasn't out of the realm of possibility to believe these to be beef flavored COWBOY strips made from real life cowboys. That thought caused my stomach to turn, and because I take great pride in leading a cannibalism free lifestyle, I decided it might be wise to contact the manufacturers of WILD RIDE just to double check--similarly I once contacted the makers of the very confusingly named 'chicken of the sea' brand tuna fish to see if it was chicken or fish; quite an important distinction! Better safe than sorry over having broken my nearly 30 year streak of cannibalism avoidance in one fell swoop, I gave WILD RIDE a call!<br /><br />Thankfully, WILD RIDE confirmed that this was in fact BEEF jerky, and that the Cowboy reference in the title was just an adjective explaining the sort of jerky it is: long, thin strips that are chewable, soft, and very, very tasty. I suggested that they rename it ""Wild Ride Beef Jerky Cowboy Strips (NOT MADE FROM COWBOYS. NO COWBOYS INJURED IN THE MAKING OF THIS JERKY)"" and they agreed such a change could potentially be useful. Much obliged for their assistance in understanding their product and their intentions (after all if they WERE selling COWBOY jerky, it might call into question what sort of operation they run, and if they are in-fact a Zombie enterprise!) I was able to enjoy all four bags of this jerky in about 30 minutes. Wishing I had more, I took a stroll to the outhouse because I suddenly wasn't feeling that well, and the next thirty minutes I spent thinking about what a great movie you could make about a Zombie owned corporation selling COWBOY JERKY to the unknowing public. I couldn't decide if I'd prefer to have Chuck Norris or Steven Seagal play the protagonist (or possibly pair them up!) or if the ending would involve a nuclear warhead wiping out the zombies or just let Chuck and Stev-o whack them apart with machetes, but at least these unanswered questions successfully distracted me from the 3.1 magnitude earthquake that was shaking the entire outhouse.<br /><br />So put your mind at ease: these are BEEF strips made in the cowboy fashion, and they're very, very tasty!"

Living alone I love K-cups ability to brew a single cup instead of wasting a whole pot. I have tried dozens of different K-cups and all of them made a decent cup of coffee but when I really wanted something good I had to use the french press. These K-cups are by far the best. I love opening up a bag of them and smelling that sweet smell of coffee, something you just don't get with the plastic ones. The taste of these is bolder and stronger than even the most potent plastic version. Lastly these will biodegrade a lot quicker than the plastic ones making them better for the environment.<br /><br />One last quick tip: Put them in a ziplock to retain that fresh ground coffee smell and taste."

I compared the caloric intake and was surprised to find that your normal 1.85 ounce Payday bar was only 10 calories more than this product which promotes itself as a ""healthy"" snack.  I'll grant them this - the Big Nut bar is better for my dental work since it doesn't have the chewy nougat filling that a Payday has but beyond that, there's not much of a nutritional difference.  I found that the Big Nut bar satisfied my need for a snack in the long stretch between lunch and dinner and since it din't make me worry about my bridgework, I'd probably keep some on hand for snacking.  The taste was very similar to a Payday bar and I liked that.  It was a little less salty and slightly less sweet.<br /><br />Here's the downside - like a lot of the tarted-up granola bars of today, The Big Nut Bar has a sweet coating on the bottom of the bar that melts easily.  The day ours were delivered it was only about 85 degrees out and that coating was liquified.  These bars would have to be kept in a cool place to be properly enjoyed because once that bottom layer melts, it's a big ole mess and no fun to eat.  Also, the wrapper was somewhat difficult to open.  I have to use scissors each time.  I didn't mind doing that but I'm a grown-up.  I can't imagine giving this snack to a kid and expecting them to deal with the wrapper without trying to tear it with their teeth!<br /><br />In summary - nice taste, virtually same calories as a Payday bar, melts easily and wrapper is hard to open.  I liked them and would buy them on sale because they taste like a Payday without having the Payday's problem of sticking to your dental work."

My only complaint would be that I wish the bar was scored so that the pieces would be a little bit smaller. Right now the bar is somewhat scored into six squares, but those are pretty big squares, so you have to break them in half to let it sit comfortably in your mouth and let it dissolve.<br /><br />That's really the best way to eat dark chocolate: put a small piece in your mouth and let it dissolve slowly . NEWMAN'S OWN DARK CHOCOLATE starts melting almost immediately into a chocolate cream that coats your tongue and the roof of your mouth, so that you get that wonderful taste just enough to satisfy a sweet craving.<br /><br />I highly recommend it to those who love chocolate, but want to skip the milk chocolate and find that other dark chocolates are too bitter.

I continued being skeptical but noticed a marked improvement in my sleeping (more relaxed) and some muscle damage I had in my leg quickly healed (after one year of pain from an injury!).  I started off slow and had to graduate to a high dose - appx 3-4 tsp per day (was having serious constipation) -- after a week or so, I tapered down to a normal dose. I got my husband hooked on this stuff for the 'relaxing' effect alone (he is on the higher energy side).  It's subtle, not a drugged feeling when I say relaxing effect ... it's similar to melatonin without any groggy feeling.  My primary use is for constipation ... no more garbage over the counter drugs.  I never found improvement from pro-biotics either. This stuff helps with bloating and overall ""uggh"" feeling.  We both really like the taste, too.  If you like it more sweet/sour, then just use less water.  It's an artificial type sweetener, so no calories ... and I normally hate artificial sweetener taste, but it's hidden well.  It's similar to crystal light ... we get the raspberry/lemon flavor.

This stuff solves the problem in a couple of important ways.  For one thing, it couldn't be easier to use.  For my 1-quart ice cream maker, I mix a package of this stuff with 1 3/4 cup of 2% milk and 1/4 cup of cream with a stick blender right in my ice cream maker's bucket.  That takes about 1 minute and I'm ready to start up the ice cream maker.  The ice cream is delicious and the results consistent each and every time.<br /><br />Because I use mostly 2% milk, my end product is low-cal compared to most recipes and virtually dietetic compared to store bought, but it is still delicious and has good consistency.  There are no off-putting ingredients in this mix, which I value highly.  I can still get special flavors of ice cream by decreasing the milk and adding, say, fresh peaches, or cherries or strawberries.  I zap them up right in with the mix and milk with the stick blender.  No mess, fast and really good.<br /><br />Because the process is so easy and satisfying, we have ice cream a lot and really get full value from our ice cream maker and since the ice cream is lower calorie and lower fat than other kinds, I don't feel guilty about this pleasure.  Very highly recommended."

The color is beautiful and white, and the smell is fresh and doesn't have the ""off"" scent some of the oils have. I love that it is organic and unrefined. I use it in cooking sometimes, but mostly, I use it as an after-shower body and face moisturizer. I rub it all over my body and then after about 20 minutes, use a dry washcloth to very lightly blot the excess off, so when I dress, I don't get oil on my clothes. This regimen makes a world of difference for my ""chicken skin""--you know, those tiny red, raised dots a person gets on their skin when it's dry--keratosis pilaris, I believe it's called.  As a woman, I do NOT find them attractive at all. So, I highly recommend this oil for cooking, and for a wonderful moisturizer. Makes your skin feel young again--very smooth and not sticky at all.

One week after I stopped using chemical sweeteners and drank a lot of water to flush my system, I was back to normal. I could get a good night sleep, wake up refreshed. Upon further research I found how damaging aspartame an splenda is to our bodies, yet we continue to see them in diet soda and other products. As a result I've grown so sensitive to that stuff that even one piece of a chewing gum containing aspartame or two sips of a drink containing splenda makes me suffer the prior side effects.<br /><br />Anyway, I love chewing gum and these are great and don't bother me at all.

It took a little getting used to-I don't cook with it, I just eat it, but once I got used to it, it was the most intense chocolate I had ever had. Dark chocolate is in the news these days-it has a lot of antioxidants and fiber and other compounds that are very beneficial. Chocolate is a plant food-it's just one that gets loaded up with sugar and milk and fat, so the health benefits are only to be found in the really dark stuff, like more than 70% cocoa. And what health benefits-preliminary studies are showing that dark chocolate can lower cholesterol and blood pressure and even increase insulin sensitivity, which can benefit diabetes and help a person lose weight. I was eating a little of this chocolate every day for my daily fix-it only has 70 calories a square, but now that it's not just an indulgence I get to feel good about eating it. And if you don't want to eat it, it's really good for baking-it's very smooth and melts and blends easily into whatever you're preparing."

That's what ""Nature's Path Love Crunch Premium Organic Granola, Dark Chocolate and Red Berries"" offers you.  Below are my impressions on this product.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- It's tasty.  I've eaten a fair amount of granola in my life, and flavoring it with chocolate actually makes it seem less granola-like, which is a good thing, if you know what I mean.  The granola has a nice chocolate flavor, not too strong and not too sweet.<br />- It's certified organic.  While I'm admittedly not an ""all natural"" kind of consumer and don't typically shop at organic food stores, I will buy (and pay more for) organic products when given a choice, provided they offer a similar taste.<br />- There are enough dark chocolate chunks to be noticible when you're eating, and they add to the positive experience<br /><br />Cons:<br />- There aren't enough dired red berries. While you can see a few small pieces in the mix, you can't readily taste them.<br />- It's a little high in calories, so portion control is essential if you're going to use this as part of your healthy eating patterns. An 11 1/2 ounce bag contains 10 servings, and each serving has 140 calories, about 40 percent is fat.  One or two servings at a time is fine, the whole bag is not.  :-)<br /><br />Overall, this is a good, tasty treat that is much better for you than cookies or ice cream and the like.  Just be sure to watch how much you eat.  Four starts."

I enjoy the flavor of ginger as well as lemon by themselves but had never put the two together, although it makes sense if it's made right because they can balance each other with the right combination of quantities, a mix of bitter, sweet and sour.  The flavor of the ginger in this instance definitely over-powered the lemon and was just altogether way too potent for my taste buds.  This may be to the liking of those who like or can handle really spicy foods but this disagreed with my sensibility.  I measured it right with 250 ml of water (about an 8 oz. cup) and I tried it both hot and cold but it was too powerful either way.  Now if they greatly reduced the amount of ginger and focused on the lemon with just a hint of ginger, they'd be onto something, but as it stands it's quite simply too strong.  The amount of lemon was just fine but someone dropped the ball when mixing it with ginger.  I like the concept but it needs more work before it's perfected."

The same rep (female) who responded to my complaint in  Dec 2011 took my call today, but not knowing I had called before, she kept insisting there has never been a complaint about rancid bits before. I told her I called in Dec and she said ""someone else likely helped you"". Not wanting to argue, I moved on, but she clearly lied to me so I thought I should update about this. I was asked to include a note this time, to say where purchased but that has nothing to do with the fact that the company thinks it's ""acceptable"" that some fat is getting thru via processing. Fat cannot be freeze-dried so it will turn rancid even if freeze dried - read my original review and see how this was answered the 1st time I called last year...Very disappointing that the company doesn't care to hold the processing plant's feet to the fire about fat getting in, but then to lie to a customer is not good. But they will honor their satisfaction guarantee! So the only way to get this issue resolved is for all of us to get refunds. All you need to do is send the proof of purchase and your invoice to the address on the bag, along with your name & address. I find that about half of the bags are rancid. Dogs don't care, but cats won't eat rancid anything so very expensive if issue is ignored. Pls help make this company fix this issue by sending proofs in and forcing them to refund. Companies ignore issues until their wallets get hit. I hate to do this, but my cats beg for these and I'm going broke replacing rancid bags!<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW: I bought two 6.2 oz bags of PureBites Chicken for dogs, first trying out a small cat size pouch found at PetSmart, and then moved up to the dog-sized bags/chunks, which I crumble with my fingers to get them smaller for my cats, who love this product BUT both of these bags purchased on Amazon had rancid chunks that smushed into slimy/greasy mush when I crumbled them.<br /><br />The company admits this happens, said it's part of the processing, nothing can be done, but it's not acceptable, and they will refund once I send proof of purchases & invoice to them.<br /><br />So it's hit or miss, and the company agrees...so just an FYI to warn others to check their bags!<br /><br />For those feeding this to dogs, and not breaking up the chunks like I do, please take note of this and check on the chunks before feeding. You can also detect a faint rancid odor if there are rancid bits in your bags.<br /><br />The reason for the rancid chunks, according to the company is that pieces of fatty chicken do get in, and fat doesn't freeze-dry, so without preservatives, it will go rancid. I knew that, but had hoped they could offer a promise to correct this; they can't and have no intention to do so. So I'll keep buying and hoping I get good bags, but will certainly take the time to get refunded whenever this occurs.<br /><br />The product is excellent when you get a good bag..just check each piece before feeding, or if you have a good nose for rancid odors, take a whiff and you'll smell the slight rancid odor, and can return the product."

It tastes like hot lemonade, nothing chalky about it which is nice. It can be drunk cold but I find that 1) it works better when used with hot water and 2) it tastes better in hot water (cold water doesn't dissolve it well enough and you end up swallowing chunks of the magnesium). Within the first day or two of taking the Calm I realized that not only was I regular but I was sleeping much better. After one mugful, I fall asleep within the hour and also the cramping I was getting in my legs at night has diminished. I started taking this for one reason but realized there are a lot of benefits to it. I will warn you, on the directions it says ""add 1oz of water, watch it fizz..."", and it FIZZES.

I love it more with each use, my skin is noticeably and increasingly softer and more supple after a few weeks of use, but even after the first use my skin felt and looked very healthy.  I have used it as a replacement for lotion, both on my body and my face.  I only need about two tablespoons to cover my entire body.  I believe it has even improved the skin on my face, which can be sensitive to synthetic lotions and break out.  The oil has a pleasant fresh coconut smell and taste, which fades after rubbing it in, so don't worry about smelling strongly of coconut (not like tanning lotion).<br /><br />As other reviewers have said: coconut oil is solid (hard vegetable shortning-like texture) at room temperature, but turns softer and eventually to liquid at 76 degrees fahrenheit.  So, it melts quickly on your skin of course.<br /><br />I also used some of the oil in a homemade hot cocoa recipe, it had a pleasant taste and didn't seem ""oily"".<br /><br />Hope this review helps!

I was weaning my daughter and wanted to put her on something I felt good about.  At the time, there was a scare regarding most powdered formulas.  Babies Only was one of the few that wasn't affected.  I also appreciated the fact that it didn't smell foul.  I figured if it smelled ok to me, it would be more appealing to my daughter and that proved to be true.  She rejected other powdered formulas, but transitioned beautifully to this one after initially trying some liquid ones that she seemed to like.  I just had a hard time finding it locally.  Only Whole Foods carried it and they were constantly running out.  Fast forward 2 years and when I was weaning my son, I immediately put him on this and he took to it well.  Again, I had trouble consistently finding it locally, so I started using Similac organic. But, as luck would have it, just a month after using it, there was another recall!  It's just too scary how often that happens with the popular brands.  When I started researching alternatives again, I found Babies Only was still the best.  I discovered that Similac Organic had an extremely high sugar content- no wonder my son liked it!  Unfortunately, Babies Only wasn't much more available, but happily I found it here on Amazon and it's basically like buying 2 and getting 1 free, with free shipping.  I just wish I had found this 2 months ago as he's just about ready to get off formula.  Anyway, I LOVE this product.  As a mom who nursed both kids for 10 months, this is the only formula I felt good about giving my kids.  Neither had any problems with digestion, transition, etc. with it.  I highly recommend it."

It does deliver a bold espresso taste in a very convenient form. I've served cappuccino portions (4oz) after dinner and people were concerned with having caffeine after dinner, surprised when they were told it was decaf. Hubby brews this decaf along with a Mocha K cup (tastes mostly like chocolate) and enjoys his own version of a mocha.<br /><br />The 2 pack price is great and we are enjoying more coffee at home and less espresso drinks out, at the savings of $3-$4 per drink."

However, the overall unit is lightweight and flimsy.  The toy in the base intrigued them but unfortunately it's not a furry mouse as shown in the picture, but instead is (was) just a paper pom-pom.  Our smallest kitty had the toy in shreds by the end of the second day.  The base of the Kong scratcher is cardboard and the unit moves at the slightest touch, so you need to add extra weight in order to use it.  We bought the Bergan Turbo Cat Scratcher at the same time, and I'd recommend it over the Kong.  The Bergan model has a similar scratching mat and a heavy plastic base that stays in place.  And our kitties love pushing the ball around the track on the Bergan.  Overall, at around $12.00, the Bergan is more expensive but promises to last much longer.<br /><br />Update on 9/07/10:  Be aware that the refills that Amazon sells to accompany this Kong cat scratcher are too big for the base.  The only way to use them is to cut them down, which is a pretty messy process.  Meanwhile, our Bergan is still going strong.  (Their refills do fit their base.)"

Recently Kettle brand Honey Dijon Mustard took that slot. So when I found out they had sour cream & onion I just had to try them.<br /><br />As soon as I opened the bag the chips smelled of powdered milk. And indeed each chip is coated with a powdered sour cream that is just awful. It tastes like rancid milk. Not just sour, but like sour cream that when rancid. The powdery texture is also extremely unappealing. I basically hated these chips. I would not recommend these chips to anyone unless they had a particular affinity for a powdery, chalky texture on a chip, with a rancid (and onion flavor) and I have a hard time believing that person exists.<br /><br />I plan on contacting Kettle and sharing my thoughts with them. Hopefully they'll reassess the seasoning on these otherwise wonderful kettle style chips."

They may take a few more seconds to brew (I haven't timed it) because the filter bag inflates with the hot water before the coffee comes out. This makes me think that the mesh bag is actually sealed somehow and that seal is broken with the pressure of the hot water as it's injected into the cup. A strong smell test indicates that there is some sort of seal there because there is not a strong coffee smell coming from the dry cups.<br /><br />If there is some sort of seal these cups should stay fresh longer than they would if the coffee was completely exposed to air. I am still storing these cups in the sealed 12 pack bags they came in and would recommend storing them in a sealed container if you don't go through them quickly. The need to store them sealed takes some convenience out of the K-cup system but the lower price of these cups should offset that.<br /><br />As for the coffee itself, it was good, strong, and tasted more like a fresh cup of coffee than any other k-cups I've tried. It could be the coffee or could be the cup itself. I plan to order a few different flavors in this cup style to find out."

209087,B00004RAMY,A16GUQL26IDGMW,Steve,0,2,1,1260576000,Use grub and insect killer instead,"We had mole tunnels throughout our lawn.  We first tried the non-lethal castor/garlic oil water spray method (twice).  It didn't work. Then we tried laying two of the Victor Out of Sight Mole Trap out.  That didn't work, either. Finally, my son spot movement in the lawn and he stomped on the tunnel.  The mole was dead. It was small, only about 4 inches.  But, it was amazing, that was the end of our problem.  Our entire lawn - which isn't small - was destroyed by ONE tiny mole.  Best advise, look for the movement of the mole in the late afternoon, than stomp on it or use a flat end of a large shovel. Moles have thin skulls so apparently they are easy to kill. One mole can do an incredible amount of damage.<br /><br />5/31/10 update:<br /><br />New season, new mole appears. Instead of using the mole trap, I tried a new approach--- kill his food source. One application of grub and insect killer and the mole is gone, probably to the neighbors yard. Everything I read on the internet suggest that you have to kill the mole but that has remained elusive except by luck. Getting rid of his food source though worked immediately. We never saw another tunnel after the grub and insect killer was applied over three weeks ago. We'll see how long it lasts but this was much easier than trying (unsuccesfully) to trap the mole."

This oil has a heavy woody scent, not as fragrant as other good EVOO in this price range. Sampled uncooked, the oil has mild initial taste, not much olive flavor at all, but not unpleasant, but what I didn't like is its harsh after-taste. It was not good in salad dressings.

Kimbo Gold is genuine espresso from Napels, famed for its incomparable coffee, and uses only the best Brazillian coffee beans.  Its taste can be best described as potent with a real kick, but without any bitterness, and with a deep yet clear espresso flavour.  I prefer it to some of the better known premium brands, such as the otherwise excellent Illy caffe. Its flavour is much richer and isn't even lost in a capuccino or latte - the milk if anything seems to bring out the flavour even more.  I highly recommend this espresso to anyone who is looking for the real thing."

I was VERY disappointed. This cheese is sharp, but lacks any of the richness and more subtle flavors of even a moderately good parmesan, and is extremely dry.

I've never truly liked Peanut Butter, in fact I loathed it for many years...but as my tastebuds matured I learned to tolerate it once in a while with chocolate or apple slices.  I've been searching for a common ground because my BF LOVES peanut butter, but only the ""kid"" kinds...loaded with sugar and hydrogenated oils.  I like the fact that nut butters can be healthy and satisfy the appetite but I just couldn't deal with the Jif any longer. :)  Well, I've found our compromise... Barney Butter is ever so slightly sweet (just enough, I think) and close enough in taste to PB that my BF likes it, yet it's missing that indefinable something that makes me dislike peanut butter so much.  Plus, the Barney Butter is WAY healthier... compare the nutritional info  on the jar of Barney Butter to your standard jar of Jif or Skippy.  I know it isn't quite as pure as some nut butters since this still contains palm oil, BUT all of the No-Stir nut butters contain palm oil...it's a compromise I can live with if it means not having to stir anything with the consistency of cement... that just too much work for a sandwich.  Anyhoo..this stuff is fabulous and I can't keep my spoon out of the jar!!!  I was very glad to see the 3-pack on Amazon.  I'm ordering it right now!!<br /><br />UPDATE:  My initial enthusiasm for Barney Butter has not waned.  Peanut Butter has never made it back into our house since.

It takes practice to carefully flush the front of the box to the hole and then gently pack dirt in the gaps to close the light.  Even when I thought it was perfect, I had gophers pack them a few times even when a carrot piece was in the back.  I have been using them for a few weeks and got 2 gophers and 1 mole.  With each kill, they are definitely dead so I didn't have to worry about one squirming.  Also, finding the hole and ensuring the gopher has easy access into the box is not easy!  The tunnels are at angles or are not clearly defined even with using a long stick or some type of rod to probe around.  The boxes do work but don't expect this to be a cake walk.  It takes around 10-15 minutes to find the tunnel, dig the hole and put the trap in while wearing some type of gloves.  Also, if you have dogs, good luck trying to keep them away.

Since I started taking this supplement a couple of weeks ago I've slept through the night every night.

I take a teaspoon in the morning and a teaspoon in the evening which i dissolve in warm water. It tastes like a bland lemonade, which is fine by me. I'm not here for the flavor, i'm here for the health benefits. My bathroom trips are more regular and my muscles don't feel as sore after I exercise. One thing I would like to note, just in case it happens for anyone else, is that the first 3 days I was getting a pain in my temple randomly throughout the day.

The Evangeline blend manages to be both robust and refined, as compared to some of the other Community offerings and remains our family favorite. The beans delivered through Amazon have a nice, freshly-roasted aroma, when you open that bag. They make a great espresso when correctly ground, and of course make a wonderful ""French Press"" made coffee.<br /><br />Our preferred method is to mix about 1/3 of these ground with the regular Community pre-ground Dark Roast in the French Press, and it gives us coffee that even ""most"" of our Texas friends enjoy.<br /><br />I'd recommend unless you are accustomed to European or Louisiana-style coffee, you cut back on the amount of this powerful but subtle coffee at first, and gradually increase the amount of coffee you use until you hit your ""sweet spot"".<br /><br />As a ""lagniappe"", I'll also offer my quick version of Cafe Brulot, and this coffee makes a great basis for it. There are many recipes around, but mine comes from the memory of watching a waiter make it some 40 years ago in a fine New Orleans restaurant. Into a caraffe, place 4 tsp turbinado sugar, 2 jiggers Cherry Heering Liqueur, 2 jiggers cognac, and 4 jiggers of Grand Marnier liqueur. Add 6-8 cups of strong, hot coffee, stir, and serve, toping each cup with a tbsp of whipped cream. How many this recipe serves depends on just how marvelous you want your day to start or your evening to end. It's great after a fine meal and while talking with friends or listening to good music.

I've always had a low tolerance for shakes and meal replacement products but I wanted to give this one a try. It's day one and I added 16oz of soymilk to the two scoops of mix. The shake got really thick like others before me experienced. Although I really didn't mind the thickness it all tasted pretty good. I was able to drink the entire serving during my morning commute to work. A few minutes later I felt full and energized to start my day. I think this really is a good supplement to my diet that covers all the bases. It was explained to me at Down To Earth that this provides everything that a multivitamin provides and more. This is what I needed for my intense workouts throughout the week. I will definitely be buying this more often.

They do not include artificial ingredients or flavorings.<br /><br />On the box, the manufacturer writes: ""From mist-covered mountains to sun-drenched deserts to fertile fields, we proudly bring you our tea palette. The flavors range from smooth earthiness, and light floral scents, to refreshingly sweet and sour notes. What they all share is the recollection of how some Ancient One tamed fire and water to coexist harmoniously, and steeped in them the gifts of Nature. Since that distant past, people have soothed, roused, healed, explored and celebrated with these wonderful infusions. We encourage you to do the same with Numi's finest.""<br /><br />The price is perfect, a big savings over single boxes. If you like Numi teas and want to sample a wonderful assortment, get it---you won't be sorry. There may be some you like and others you don't, but sampling them will be a delightful experience. If you are new to Numi this is an excellent way to sample their high-quality teas. I do not think you could find a better source of premium tea than Numi.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****"

My vet wanted her on canned food that was low in carbs, but Gracie didn't care for it the prescription brand I was buying at the vet.  Also, I noticed on the can that corn was an ingredient.  I asked her about this, considering corn is a sugary veggie and she also wanted Gracie to lose about 3-4 lbs.  She told me that the main idea was to have her eat a canned food that was 8% or less in carbohydrates IN A DRY STATE.  That means, they take the food, dry it out and get the true percentages of carbs, etc.<br />When I did some research on the web about pancreatitus in cats, I found that GRAIN in cat food can bring on and/or aggravate the condition. I read many articles that explained that cats DON'T NEED grain in their diet.  Pet food manufacturers put it in there because it sounds good to us, the pet owners, when we read that the food contains brown rice, etc.  But what's good for us, as we all know, isn't always good for them.<br /><br />I looked at many companies that made Grain-Free food and was very impressed w/Wellness.  They have many varieties that are grain-free.  When I called them to get the percentage of carbs in a dry matter basis, they were prepared and quick to answer w/out having to transfer me 10 times.<br />The food is not inexpensive, but my cat REALLY likes it.  This bout w/pancreatitis occured about 4 years ago. She has been on Wellness ever since and is in excellent health. She is now 14 yrs old.<br /><br />I highly endorse this product.  If I get another cat someday, I will feed her grain-free food from kittenhood.<br />BTW, they also make grain-free dry food, but I haven't tried it.<br /><br />Good luck!<br />Allie"

Every trip to the store, I go down the candy aisle, to if nothing else, pause to decide if licorice is on the mental shopping list.  I must admit that I've never seen this offering in any grocery store, but on my next trip to Whole Foods, I'll certainly take a look.<br /><br />Overall, the licorice is quite tasty but not what I would call addictive.  It definitely was fresh and closer to ""Twizzler"" consistency than ""Red Vines"".  I usually buy Red Vines that are both tasty and inexpensive.  I believe that the makers of this licorice were aiming for the 1930s type of candy store licorice instead of the mass produced taste of Red Vines.  If you examine the price of 40 dollars (Amazon's listed price) for a total of 75 ounces (pack of 15 x 5 ounces per pack = 75 ounces), you'll quickly see that the price per pound is about $4.25 a pound (16 ounces).  This compared with other higher produced licorices is much more than a 3:1 cost of either Twizzlers or Red Vines.  Clearly, Newman's Own Organics is going for the more discriminating licorice consumer.<br /><br />In summary ...<br /><br />Pros<br />Very tasty<br />Fresh<br />Decent consistency<br />Organic (although I honestly don't know how big a benefit this is for licorice)<br /><br />Cons<br />May be costly for the average consumer<br />Tastes a bit like Fruit Roll-ups (making it a bit of a Fruit Roll-ups for adults)<br /><br />Happy Eating!"

Unlike the other flavors, which are very often poor remakes of classic brands, the orange flavor is unique. It has qualities of Orange Crush and Sunkist, but adds an original flavor that only it has.  Overall, it is a great flavor, and even pop snobs will likely enjoy it.  If you can't live without the classics, any flavor (including Orange) is not worth buying though, so be cautious, and try buying one instead of a three pack the first time."

I've tried both available flavors of Orgain and I find the chocolate to have no remnant of soy protein in its taste.  The shake tastes great at room temp and amazing chilled.  I appreciate that there's some remnants of veggies and fruit in the shake too.<br /><br />Potential downsides:<br />It's not all oil, sugar, and protein....although its mostly that...  So it's not exactly as good as sitting down and eating a sandwich.  The shake is only made in pre-measured little boxes so there's no opportunity to save some money with a tub of a dry mix.  The shakes are expensive too.  The trade off is better ingredients, instead of unpronounceable and artificial junk found in say, Slimfast (although that too is mostly oil, sugar, and protein...just from worse ingredient sources).  The shake is also not vegan if that's something you're looking for.  There's currently only 2 flavors of the shake too, so if variety's your thing, this isn't a good shake to try out long term.<br /><br />I still rate this 5 stars for the ingredients, the taste, and the fairly extensive nutrition content.

As a mature exerciser, recovery is always the biggest challenge, and this product eliminated my reliance on OTC anti-inflammatories.  I'm a physiologist who did contract work for a magnesium manufacturer and I've read most of the medical literature on Mg2+'s importance in the management of diabetes and vessel disease, and I don't think there's a better product than this one to address those issues. As magnesium pulls water into the gut, IMO it's the best remedy for sluggish elimination, and you must build the dose up slowly to prevent stools that are too loose.  For people with constipation, it's pretty much guaranteed to provide an immediate and permanent remedy.  And as magnesium is critical for the complete relaxation of muscle fibers, it's a first line treatment for chronic pain of any kind.  Even after months of using the Gilham Calm products, I still have to have my evening pretty much wrapped up before taking the supplement as it really knocks me out for sleep.  Deeper and more refreshed sleep is also a main objective to any chronic pain condition.<br /><br /> I switched to the Osteo Calm a couple of months ago in my desire to add a better piece to my menopausal osteoporosis prevention, and have found that product to be completely awesome also."

Then Wedderspoon made changes that I find unacceptable. The first had to do with their label, which most people don't bother to read since the label color didn't change. Gone was organic certification by Ecosert SA. Gone was ""Support the OMA mark which guarantees honey that is free from chemicals and pesticides."" Missing are the following: Never feeding the bees sugar, area of forage is 5 km. from intensive farming, Ecosert approval. Added was the word ""harmful"" before chemicals and pesticides. Obviously, chemicals and pesticides are added and we are supposed to hope they are not harmful.<br /><br />Then I noticed that batch 110576 was definitely ""watery"" compared to earlier batches. It had nothing to do with the weather because last summer was just as hot and the manuka was just fine. Batch 110583 was almost as runny as 110576. Then came another shipment from Amazon.com that was packed very securely, but there was leaked honey all over the box. Amazon.com reimbursed me, but it wasn't their fault. The outer seal was intact but there was no inner seal. This runny honey had no difficulty passing between the jar and the cover.<br /><br />Additionally, although it no longer affects me, it appears that Wedderspoon followed through and no longer sells direct to Amazon.com, which raises the price a little more.<br /><br />I rated this product one star so I could submit my review.

I think this is due to it being pasture fed and non-homogenized which is probably not true for the other product.  It is a bit more expensive, but the benefits of grass fed cannot be overstated when it comes to Ghee.  The only other Ghee I would recommend is Ancient Organics which is also prepared in the traditional way, but it is a bit more expensive than this brand.

Oddly enough, it doesn't have as much pumpkin flavor!<br /><br />Honestly, it makes my home-made pumpkin pie taste more like a cheap store-bought.  Really not nearly as good as when I use Libby pumpkin.  I'm say to say this, as I really prefer organic products, but when it changes the texture and flavor this much, I cannot recommend it.  Too bad I still have another can.<br /><br />If you do end up purchasing some to try, I'd recommend adding just a little extra sugar to your pie to help enhance flavors.  Add a little more cinnamon, too."

After years of eating ""normal"" food, I struggled to find adequate replacements.  I laid awake at night trying to figure out how to feed my child.  This product is a Godsend.  I tried many blends (my own and other mixes), but this is the closest I can find that does the trick.  Is it a perfect replacement for the flour?  NO!  How could it be?  It is what it is... a substitute for people who can't eat the real thing.  I make pancakes, biscuits, doughnuts, muffins, etc. with no problem.  I am able to use this as a thickener also.  I search websites and cookbooks for recipes that I can utilize and I experiment.  That is all you can do.  I also recommend the waffle and pancake mix from Namaste.  I use it to make waffles, which I freeze.  Namaste also has a cookbook they will send you if you contact them.  It has been a great resource.

I was also surprised to discover that these work great to control small fruit flies, coffin flies, and gnats. The key is to always place them along the wall or in corners. Theyre good to place behind furniture and especially near electrical outlets, as these are the most common paths that insects take when navigating through your home. If you catch nothing at all, move the traps to other areas around the house and try again. They're cheap enough that you should buy more than you think you'll need and then place a couple in each room. Keep in mind that the more you place strategically around the more likely you'll trap insect that treads close enough to catch the scent and investigate. Good luck!"

I really love the Indian and Thai fusion of flavors in this tea. A perfect combination I must say. I like the coconut taste in this tea, and when it comes to Thai-inspired at-home teas, this Celestial Seasonings Sweet Coconut Chai definitely tastes better than Yogi Tea's Sweet Thai Delight tea. It's also a bonus that this tea is decaffeinated, and as the other Amazon reviewers have said, this tea is definitely perfect for relaxation and before going to bed. If you like Thai-inspired teas such as this, I also suggest trying Harney and Sons' Bangkok Green Tea with Thai Flavors. It's an excellent, delicious fine tea with coconut, vanilla, ginger, and lemongrass. I also highly recommend The Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf's Thai-picked Lemon Chamomile, Blueberry Peach Green Tea, and Spring Peach Oolong Teas. Another tea with some Thai influence is the Fairmont Hotels and Resorts' Organic Berry Berry Caffeine-Free tea. For cold Thai teas, I highly recommend Taste Nirvana's Real Thai Tea Latte and Real Green Tea Latte. My parents were born and raised in Thailand, and thus I'm Thai American. If you actually visit Thailand, which I have multiple times since the majority of my relatives live there, then I highly recommend trying Thai Chrysanthemum tea. I had the best tea I've ever had in my entire life in Thailand. And that's saying something because I've actually traveled up (sometimes my small traveling party and I had to walk a long and grueling hike for intervals of 30 minutes to a whole hour. Even actor Blair Underwood made a comment how he was amazed that even elderly Chinese women could climb up these mountains for long periods of time, and claimed they were in better shape than him! That's how I felt as well. If you visit China, you will see that a lot of Chinese are very physically fit - they walk, hike, bike a lot and do all sorts of exercises such as swimming and Tai Chi and fan exercises in their parks) the tea-growing terraced mountains in and around the Guilin region of China and tasted tea from those Chinese regions and also tasted some tea when I traveled to Japan, but those Asian teas don't compare to the Chrysanthemum tea I had many years back in northern Thailand. (I haven't traveled to England and India yet, but would love to. I bet the teas there are amazing. But like I said, from all the countries I've traveled to so far - Thailand has the best teas, cold and hot.) When I think about it, I was very young then, and I should have asked the Thai waitress where they got their tea from. All I know is that I drank that tea at a restaurant at a Thai hotel resort many years back in Northern Thailand not far from Chiang Rai and the Golden Triangle region. Anyways, I have given boxes of this Celestial Seasonings Sweet Coconut Thai Chai Decaf Tea as small gifts to friends in the past few years. The fact that you can order this in packs of six at an affordable price is great, and allows you the luxury to share some of this tea with friends and family. My verdict is that this is a nice aromatic, delicious tea to unwind for the day."

Second, cut them up, they usually are very very long, and than put them in a hot pan on medium heat so that the water will evaporate and while i do that i continue to blot them with paper towels, until they are very dry.

A lot of prepared herb and spice mixes on the market seem to be full chemicals that I can't pronounce and they taste very dull, extremely salty and have a strange, artificial after-taste. NOT THIS ONE!<br /><br />When my order arrived the first thing that I did was to taste the mixture straight out of the jar. I was surprised at how clean and fresh the taste was. I picked up on the herbs (I'm thinking oregano, basil, parsley, rosemary and maybe some mint), the sea salt and then the sweetness of the bell pepper combined with a tartness of the lemon juice. There was a slight bit of heat (the garlic?) and a nice, pure, food-like aftertaste.<br /><br />Next I mixed it with some fine olive oil and used it as a dip for some crusty Italian bread. Wonderful! Later in the week I used it, along with some Dijon Mustard, as a coating for a rack of lamb. I ended up adding a little crushed black pepper to the mix and it was great.<br /><br />Finally I used it as a salad dressing along with aged balsamic vinegar, wine vinegar and extra virgin olive oil. It took a few minutes to get the proportions right, and I did add a little chopped rosemary and some fresh minced garlic. It was much better than any prepared dressing that comes in a bottle.<br /><br />I was really impressed with the flavor and quality of this prepared mix, so much so that I ordered this variety pack.  Here are my thoughts on the other two varieties that come with this set:<br /><br />*  French Garden<br />At first taste it seemed salter than the Italian version.  The chives not only tasted fresh but still retained their classic oval shape (meaning that they were not over-processed or ground to death).  The garlic and onions were strong, but not too.  I also picked up on the parsley and I thought I tasted a little tarragon.  I added this mix to a French style omelet (runny).  Very nice!  My fear of it being too salty was put to rest.  I next sprinkled it on some grilled eggplant and I was blown away!  It woke up the subtle flavors of the vegetable.  I will be trying this is other dishes to be sure.<br /><br />*  Napa Garden<br />This mix had a different texture than the others, probably due to the tomato powder which added a wonderful richness to the blend.  This one was not as salty as the other two.  The pepper gave it a little heat but I usually like more (which is easy to add, hard to take out). I tried this (along with some olive oil) with spinach angel-hair pasta.  That turn out to be a good choice.  The mix did not overwhelm the flavor of the pasta but added that extra kick.<br /><br />I highly recommend this variety pack.  All three will become staples in my spice cabinet."

The guide showed us the bales of tea as they arrived, machines that ground and mixed the tea, and a machine that put the tea in tea bags.  The tour included a visit to the room where the peppermint tea was stored.  Our guide told us that peppermint was stored separately so that it would not contaminate the other teas.  He did not tell us what was to come.<br /><br />The doorway into the peppermint room was surrounded by bright red stripes. This should have served as a warning to us.  We all innocently strolled into the peppermint room.  The smell of peppermint was overpowering.  It entered my nose, my head, my lungs, and then my whole being was infused with peppermint.  What a rush!  The crowd stampeded out of the room in a hurry.  For the rest of the day and into the next, all I could smell and taste was the mint.<br /><br />I am now addicted to <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E63L8S"">Celestial Seasonings Peppermint Tea</a>.  Every time I have some, I am reminded of that fateful day in Boulder.  The events of that day have changed my life forever.  Amazingly, the tea is still legal, openly sold in stores and on the Internet.  I think that the tea is great, but then again I am not an unbiased observer.  On your next visit to Boulder, take the tour.  Or go a safer route; buy the tea from Amazon."

For reference, don't ask your vet - do some Internet research at sites like, for example, [...]. What you'll find is that even the supposed ""high-end"" lines from basically every major supermarket label are horrible for your fuzzy friends. People who trust the marketing or trust their vets overpay and feed their cats foods that are full of carcinogens, cheap ingredients that are inappropriate for a cat's digestive system, and byproducts that provide nothing of value and are basically a way to make cheap profit off of literal garbage. It's a tragedy, as these same cats end up with shorter lifespans, kidney problems, UTIs, cancer, and a host of other issues, all of which could have been avoided by a high quality food.<br /><br />This is an A-Grade food. What you'll find here is very high protein content, many meat meals, potatoes, salmon oil, flax seed, and no grains, which is great as a cat is not an omnivore, it's a carnivore, and it simply does not need grains. It has 50 percent protein, which is among the highest you'll see in cat food. The first 4 ingredients are all meats.<br /><br />What you will NOT find here is the kind of junk you'll see in things like Purina One and Science Diet - byproducts (aka beaks, feathers, bird feet), brewers rice (aka the waste product from making beer), wheat flour (a leading cause of pet allergies), corn gluten (a cheap waste of space), and things like ""liver flavor"" (because they don't want to pay for the real thing). I didn't just pull those ingredients out of the air - I was reading the ingredients list of Purina One. It's pathetic.<br /><br />Don't feed your cats trash. Pay a little more to feed them good food now, and they'll lead longer, healthier, more satisfied lives as a result. It's worth it."

The lemongrass moderates the slight bitterness that is common in plain green tea. I've experimented with adding a twist of lemongrass to a plain organic green tea, and the flavor is similar. The lemongrass complements the green tea flavor, deletes any hint of bitterness, and contributes a very faint lemon scent and flavor that can't be duplicated with ordinary lemon. I drink other green teas (for example, Tazo's decaf Lotus at night, or Tazo's jasmine when I'm in that flowery jasmine mood), but Zen is far and away my favorite.

Another reviewer mentioned that the grains are not stuck together. That is very true (low starch) but the best thing is the flavor contained within this rice. Once it is cooked, each grain is delicious and full of flavor. This is the quality where Tilda shines above the rest. The grains are not just long and separate, they are delicious. When I run out and can't find Tilda, I buy something else from Indian stores in Queens. Some are very good, but not as good as Tilda. When you cook it, the aroma builds up - the scent of sacks and far-away places - like nothing else. It goes very nicely with some quality saffron. I find that Tilda is perfect with Turkish or Moroccan food and is great for pilafs (of all sorts, but especially amazing with lamb)."

I love the HappyBaby brand in general and so does my son, who is 11 months old.  I'm not saying this is a bad product, but I definitely would not buy it in bulk before you let your child try it.  You are much safer doing that with the fruit/veggie mixes.  Try before you buy seems like common sense.  However, the only store that carries this brand locally for me (Target) has a very limited selection so I couldn't let my son try this flavor before I bought it.  I imagine that is the same for other people shopping on-line.  I thought I could mix it with something else if he didn't care for it, but he will have nothing to do with it, mixed or otherwise.  I have to say that I agree with another review that says it looks & smells like cat food.  I try all of the food I feed my son and thought this product was bland, bordering on bad tasting.  I give it 3 stars, because I think this product is definitely not for everyone, and more of an acquired taste.  I highly recommend HappyBaby though!"

They all live with my husband and me as pets. (We're  slightly nuts, but have a good setup for the dogs,  so although many are AKC Champions, they can all be ""pets"" , in retirement.All are housebroken and well trained...none will ever leave our home.)<br />I came to this dog food a fairly short time ago, but I'll never look back.<br />It's not inexpensive, but the smaller portions needed because of the high quality of the ingredients, bring down the cost per dog. Weight control is amazing, and the lack of ""fillers"" makes every bite a healthy one.

I popped the first capsule into the machine and pulled down the lever and heard the pop of the capsule and soon smelled a very pleasant aroma that immediately reminded me of the Italian coffee shops of Milan.  THe Espressivo had a very strong taste and a smooth finish and gave me just the right lift I was looking for.  I then had a latte the next day and the combination of milk & crema was perfect- I am sold.

I figured this would be the greatest box of candy I ever bought, one that would combine my moderate love of sweets and my gigantic love of my hometown.<br /><br />I anticipated the arrival of my candy for several days; each day bring me closer and closer to the edge of expectation overload.

We started out excited about the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LQCOIS"">Beaba Babycook Baby Food Maker</a> and after reading the reviews and getting our hands on it we changed our mind. Simply put there are three BIG problems.<br />1. It is hard to keep clean especially the reservoir.<br />2. It has a limited lifespan since all it makes is baby food.<br />3. It is very expensive for what you get.<br />Since we were free of the Bebycook we now had some money to spend so I bought a beautiful <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002KQ66VY"">Mauviel M'Cook 5 Ply Stainless Steel 8 Inch Steamer Insert</a> to cook her food in.

Finally I use the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0027UYT4O"">Beaba Multiportion Freezer Tray - Green</a> freezer tray to store her food. Believe it or not the Beaba Babycook cost the same as a Mauviel steamer and a LT Mouli food mill combined, both of which are top of the line dishwasher-safe 18/10 stainless steel cooking masterpieces made in France. After your little one starts eating 'real' food the Beabe Babycook is just a hard to clean useless plastic paperweight made in China.

The consistancy is also quite nice, there is a crunch to them, but the chips arent so hard as if you're chewing glass or some foreign matter; eating these won't make sensitive teeth hurt. They also come in a four ounce bag; enough to satisfy but not make you feel bloated and easy to count calories if you care about such things.  If you like your snacks with a seafood taste there really isn't a downside to this brand.  Enjoy.  Hope this helps."

I decided against IAMS a long time ago because of their issues with animal cruelty while doing their nutrition/diet tests on animals.<br /><br />Today I decided to buy them Newman's Own Adult Cat.

If all goes well, I'll keep buying it despite the slightly higher price.  (The price at Whole Foods was similar to the price here on Amazon... where can I get this for the other price people have seen?  That's like half the price... are you guys sure you're getting the same size bags?)

I don't need your novice, pseudo medical opinion for a product you have not tried. You are as bad as the people that review a recipe after they change 6 ingredients and then say it was just okay. They didn't review the recipe at hand! I digress... The company has been making this stuff for over 30 years and have not seen any issues or side effects. In fact, dogs and cats seem to love it and they seem happier with better coats. From the Avoderm website:<br /><br />""SAFETY<br />You can feel quite confident in AvoDerm¬Æ pet products safety and nutritional value. In the over 30 years since Breeder's Choice first introduced this product line, millions of dogs and cats worldwide have consumed AvoDerm¬Æ with no negative reactions from avocado oil or meal.<br /><br />AvoDerm¬Æ pet products use only carefully selected suppliers of avocado meal and avocado oil. Years of problem-free consumption of these products indicate that AvoDerm products are not only safe for dogs and cats, but also provide vital nutrients for them.<br /><br />Concern has been expressed by the ASPCA about the consumption of the leaves, fruit, bark, and stems from the avocado tree, with the exception of the avocado fruit which is used for the oil and meal; none of these parts are factors in any of the AvoDerm¬Æ pet products formulations and we have no indication that avocado oil and meal as used in AvoDerm¬Æ are toxic, poisonous, harmful or bad for your dogs or cats diet.<br /><br />Dr. Art Craigmill, UC Davis, Professor and Extension Specialist in Environmental Toxicology has said that his studies and other research in the United States and Australia have shown that the problem of toxicity is in the leaves and the pit of the Guatemalan variety; the avocado meat of the fruit and oils have not been shown to be toxic. AvoDerm pet products do not utilize any Guatemalan variety avocados, nor do we use any leaves or pits of any variety of avocados for our avocado meal and oil.<br /><br />The avocado meal and oil used in the AvoDerm pet products comes from the meat of the fruit and does not contain leaves, bark, skin or pit of the fruit. The oil is extracted from ripened fruit in which the meat pulp has been separated from the skin and the pit. Through a mechanical separation process the oil is extracted and filtered and placed into sealed containers. The pulp of the fruit is dried, ground, and screened before being placed into its final packaging and than shipped to our facility.""<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:<br />Do your own research, research the company or the claims about the ingredients or try it for yourself. My dog (Yorkshire Terrier) seems to love this food. He gets excited and waits by his bowl when he knows it is almost time to eat. He does this even for just the dry food alone! Other dry foods that I have tried before would require me to mix in some wet food after a while to make it more appealing. Not Avoderm - he is still always excited to eat it. He also gets a spoonful of the wet food in the afternoon as a snack and he goes even more bonkers for that stuff. I am happy with it - I will be trying the grooming products next."

Still hopeful, I mixed them together with spaghetti sauce and grated parmesean cheese and let them sit overnight in the frig (as sometimes the flavors can make it better the second day).

532554,B000CSBVLW,A2R6RA8FRBS608,Matthew G. Sherwin,0,0,4,1185753600,Great cereal but a few health issues...,"Kellogg's Apple Jacks provide a delicious, sweet cereal to start anyone's day! Amazon correctly notes that this cereal is made from wheat and corn. It seems like Apple Jacks have been around forever; and it's not hard to see why. With their tasty, sweet flavor you can get your kids to chow down on something half-way nutritious before they go to school; and you can even treat yourself to a bowl of these in milk now and then. They can even be eaten dry as a snack.<br /><br />Apple Jacks does indeed contain no cholesterol and the fat content is almost zero--hooray! There aren't even trans-fats in this cereal. What a relief! Apple Jacks are kosher as well if that matters to you. They contain 25% of the recommended daily allowance of Iron, Niacin, B12, B6 and more.<br /><br />A major advantage to eating Apple Jacks within the individual cups is that you can keep the sealed cups in a child's lunch box, a backpack, your briefcase, pocketbook or anything similar you may be carrying. That way the sealed cup automatically serves a dual purpose--it prevents the cereal from spilling onto anything else someone may be carrying while keeping the cereal in a measured portion that goes easy on diets. The compact cup is also very easy and lightweight to carry. Once the cup is opened by tearing off the cover anyone can just add milk or eat them dry as a sugar boost snack.<br /><br />Unfortunately, every cereal has its drawbacks; and Apple Jacks cereal is no exception. Apple Jacks contains sugar which can turn into fat inside your body if you don't get enough exercise. Moreover, Apple Jacks contains carbohydrates. If any of this is a concern for you, ask your doctor if you should be eating this cereal.<br /><br />I would also recommend that you eat Apple Jacks cereal before the expiration date stamped on the box. You wouldn't want to eat stale cereal, now would you? SMILE<br /><br />Overall, Apple Jacks is a great way to get kids to eat something for breakfast before school without completely sacrificing nutrition. You can eat them as a snack or eat them as a sugar boost snack during the day if you are on the go and can't stop for something more substantial.<br /><br />I recommend this cereal for kids--and us grown-ups, too, who are able to eat Apple Jacks without going against any dietary restrictions your doctor may have given you.<br /><br />Enjoy!"

I've purchased the boxes of 20 and used them even two years past expiration (odd, yes), but the flavor hasn't weakened.  Here, I've outright bought a bulk-packaged box to reduce packaging waste.  You get 100 teabags, each foil-wrapped (same as always).  My review is identical to what I've written for the 6 20-count boxes:<br /><br />Simply stated, I've been drinking this specific tea for several years now after an experiment went (happily) well. Some friends have found it to be too sweet, but they needed to be corrected in that no sugar is required (because they inadvertently added some). The tea provides more than enough natural sweetness of its own with no aftertaste (albeit a pleasant one, if it turns out that you're a little ill and therefore a trifle phlegmy... there, I said it).<br /><br />It mixes exceptionally well with green tea, though I've found not so much with certain black teas like Irish Breakfast -in which case I'd recommend avoid adding milk if you're normally inclined to do so with any kind of black tea. It is decaffeinated, so this is a perfect ""unwinding"" drink before bedtime. Not ""spicy"" in the classic sense at all, either. I thoroughly and highly recommend this variety of Stash tea."

Still mixed about cats...,"As a veterinarian, I've dispensed a lot of medications for both dogs and cats...that is, until I had to start medicating my own pets.  I've became a lot more empathetic now that I've realized that I can barely pill my own cat (who runs away from me), and that my dog will not take pills in cheese or peanut butter. In fact, pilling my own pets has smartened me up on what meds pets really need. As a result, I've started prioritizing pills - in other words, I rank the order of importance of each prescription for pet owners, so they know which pills are an absolute MUST give, and which ones they can skip if they are getting desperately fed up with pilling.<br /><br />Since then, my life has changed... thanks to Pill Pockets. I regret not inventing these, as it was one of those ""duh"" products that came out, making you wish you had the money-making patent.  Whoever owns a dog that needs to be pilled chronically, pay heed. The Greenies Pill Pockets are awesome... that is, for dogs, at least.<br />My dog recently got put on a bunch of medications, and he's super picky (although less so, since getting put on steroids!). Being that he needs a total of 5 medications a day, I found Pill Pockets to be a true life saver, as they improve both my dog's and my quality of life. These little tasty, greasy, soft, malleable pockets are designed so that you can stick the pill (or multiple pills) in the center, and seal them into a hidden ball of ""treat.""  It's like playing with palatable play-dough. Drop it in the food, and voila, it ""makes pills a treat to give!""<br /><br />The pros: Pill Pockets are easy, convenient, tasty, and come in multiple flavors (Dog: beef and chicken; Cat: salmon and chicken. It also comes in a hypoallergenic flavor - duck and pea - for both species with food allergies). More importantly, they are palatable - dogs seem to love them. Another pro is that they come in multiple sizes, and I'm able to stuff 5 pills - yes all 5 pills - into the larger ""capsule"" dog Pill Pockets.<br /><br />The cons:  One of my two cats won't touch Pill Pockets. This is, of course, the cat who actually needs to take medication. He also won't touch Feline Heartgard monthly chewable pills either, so I suspect he doesn't like moist treats. So, try at your own risk, particularly if you have a finicky cat. The other con is that Pill Pockets are a bit greasy - they have a high vegetable oil content. As ingredients are listed in order of use, vegetable oil is #4 for the dog pill pockets. While this doesn't affect the health of your pet, a hand-washing is a MUST after playing with Pill Pockets (which you should always do when handling your pet's meds, anyway). That said, I know that the vegetable oil is needed to keep the Pill Pockets malleable (easy to fold and maneuver). The other con - cost. They're not cheap, and if your pet is on loads of meds, it can certainly add up. Try jamming 5 pills in one capsule to help. But anything for Fido, right?!<br /><br />For dogs, 5 stars. For cats, I'm only giving 3 stars, as only one of my two cats will eat them!<br /><br />Dr. Justine Lee, DVM, DACVECC<br />Author of ""It's a Dog's Life... but It's Your Carpet"" and ""It's a Cat's World...

Shake the heck out of it for about 15-20 seconds, then pour into a tall glass.

The other three gave it their licked-clean food bowl seal of approval.<br /><br />The cans are small (the ""mini"" can size much like Fancy Feast) which is a good match for single cat households since you don't have to deal with leftovers. The smell is much better than the low-cost can foods, and about on a par with the more premium brands such as Hills. The chicken pot pie was VERY watery, however - more like a soup than a stew. The sesame chicken was a bit more solid. The watery nature of the product also makes it messy to serve. To me, it's not a very good value especially considering that you're paying for a lot of water.<br /><br />I don't think I'd get this again given the cost and the mess factor, plus the fact that  there are several other brands that provide top-notch nutrition at a lower cost (and less mess).

He will gobble it down with no problem. However, if I try to use any larger pill such as a Heartworm pill or Allergy pill in them, he will eat the treat part off & spit out the medicinal pill.

For 24 bottles I paid about $30.<br /><br />Onward to the product review.<br /><br />So I have been using these off and on since our baby boy was born in the hospital, where they supplemented him using this product while his mothers breast milk came in.  Today almost a month later we are still using this product.<br /><br />I have had some mixed results with this product, causing my son to have some gas, reflux, spit-ups, and rare vomiting (although not exclusively Enfamil's fault), but for the most part he seems to keep this down and enjoy it.  It also seems to mix fairly friendly with his moms breast milk, so if my boy is really hungry I can confidently give him both and not cause issue.<br /><br />If you can get around the price, reason with yourself, because let me tell you how convenient this product really is: The product comes in a ready-to-go bottle, and all you have to do is attach a screw-on nipple.  This is perfect for when you are up at 3AM feeding your baby (when you are tired as hell) and you have no breast milk around, or when you're out and about and you just want to quickly feed your baby.<br /><br />I have had great success using this product with my son versus using another powdered make-it-yourself product, wherein my baby was much more pleased to drink and digest this product from the latter.<br /><br />The shelf life is pretty good because you can keep this bottle out at room temperature for an hour, and store it in the refrigerator for about 2 hours or so.  Honestly, that's great because it is often the case that your baby is going to drink the entire bottle or close to it when you start your feeding anyway.<br /><br />So although the price is not as cheap as some others... the convenience factor, paired with the amount per bottle for a feeding, really makes this product worth it.  This is the only formula product I buy my son at the moment, and it seems to be working quite well."

I know it helped me sail through that move, even though I'm no longer young.<br /><br />I buy my Tulsi Tea through Amazon because the price is better than at Organic India website, or the health food store.I buy Chai Masala by the case (6 boxes), and this further decreases the price.<br />I strongly recommend this tea nto anyone who'd like a very calming, centering, yet invigorating tea."

Typically, they involve a stale cookie with too much crumble, too much poor quality dark chocolate, and not enough taste...This one however, is different! Let me start with the price: on Amazon I paid 40% less (!!!) with free delivery, then in my grocery store! Hurray! Other then that, why Nonni's?<br /><br />1) They are not as dry and crumbly as other biscotti I have tried over the years. The toffee adds a bit of moisture without being gooey. They are gentler on my teeth, but still with enough cruch to make one biscotti a satisfying snack (at 110 calories), and allow for dunking.<br /><br />2) Individually wrapped, they keep fresh and moist (as moist as a bicotti can possibly be...) for quite a long while. It is good to have an extra box or two for unexpected guests.<br /><br />3) MILK chocolate!!! (I HATE dark chocolate...I'd rather eat spinach...but that is what most biscotti are covered in).

I'm a big drinker of hot tea though (and that's usually what I drink).  The only coffee I've ever had seemed terrible to me (then again, cheap crappy coffee probably really is terrible).  I wouldn't have normally ordered this, but the description sounded so nice and tasty that I decided to give it a try.  I went in not expecting to like it much though.<br /><br />So, I pulled out my boyfriend's tiny coffee pot to brew up some of this coffee.  The first thing that struck me as nice was that each packet of coffee is individually sealed, and each packet is contained in its own little filter (which is very convenient).  When I first brewed up a batch, I accidentally brewed it too weak (I made about 4 cups when the directions say to only make 1 cup).  I liked it a lot anyway; it reminded me of my favorite blend of carob tea.  To be fair to the coffee, though, I decided to brew it again following the directions properly.  It came out stronger (and I didn't enjoy the coffee bitterness as much) but it was still good.  I was able to drink it with only sugar and no creamer to dilute it's flavor.  I must say that in my limited experience, this is the best coffee I've ever tasted, but I think that I much prefer a light brew coffee.<br /><br />So, this is a great coffee for people who don't normally drink coffee.  Would a coffee lover actually enjoy it?  Well, if you like a really strong bitter coffee, then you really wouldn't care for this.  If you like a light or medium strength coffee, then you'll really love this one.  If you are just starting out with coffee drinking, this would be a good one to try out to ease you into it.  I liked it well enough that I'd even consider drinking it regularly along with my tea!  So, if any of this sounds appealing to you, go ahead and give it a try!"

It's not available locally in stores, and I learned that my mole problem would not be fixed using gopher/mole bait.<br /><br />This trap is fairly large.  It's all-metal with a VERY strong spring.  It's not the easiest thing to set, requiring a fair amount of force, and you need to be very careful with it.  If you catch a finger in it, I have no doubt you'd break it and you'd have a very difficult time trying to get out of it with only one working hand, so use care!!!<br /><br />The instructions could be a little more clear, but the trap is easy to figure out how it works once you examine it and set it once.  You do need to find a good location to set it, and make sure to create the mound in the middle that rests very closely to the trigger.  It only takes about 10 minutes to set once you figure it out.  I can probably do it under 5 minutes now.<br /><br />I suggest covering the trap with an upside down plastic pot with a weight on top to block out the light and to keep kids and other animals from accidentally getting into to it.  While the jaws will be below ground, it's still not something you'd want to trip or step on just in case.<br /><br />I set three of these traps along with 2 pairs of Trapline (check them out too... you'll have to search for them yourself... it's a California thing), not certain which would work and I was quite determined to get rid of my mole problem ASAP once it (or they) dug over 20 holds in my new lawn in 2 days.  The next morning... already caught the mole!  It was trap cleanly around the hips.  It wasn't a bloody mess at all, but it probably died from a combination of internal injuries, a broken spine, and asphyxiation.  Regardless, it was VERY dead.<br /><br />Bottom line... this trap is EFFECTIVE.  And that's the best I could ask for.  I probably have an overkill of traps, but I have extensive tunneling in my yard and wanted to catch the mole quickly before it did more damage.  I LOVE this trap and highly recommend it!"

They were sloppy and water/coffee dribbled out all over.  At first it was really bad, then after experimenting, I found it was only limitedly messy.  At least the removable cup stand caught all the excess rather than like at first where it spilled all over the counter.  I tried filling the k-cup full with coffee; filling it full and tamping it down; filling it partially - no way worked without a dribbly mess.  It was a lot of extra work, too, rinsing the cups out, letting them dry, filling them, etc.  Hassle!  I liked the idea of using my own coffee cuz we like Starbucks and their k-cups are really expensive.  Now we just buy our k-cups at Sam's Club.  Best price, even beats Costco.  They have several brands and I don't feel guilty throwing away the used cups.  Will save our Starbucks for our ""regular"" coffee maker when we want a treat.

I bought these based on all the positive reviews as a desperate attempt to find something that would stop our female tabby from throwing up 2-3 times a day, every time she ate.  I've been giving both our cats 3 a day (less than the ""treament"" amount but more than the ""maintenance"" amount), and in the past month, the tabby has thrown up maybe 2 or 3 times total.  Our boy cat, who had hairballs more rarely (maybe one every other week), hasn't had a single one since they started getting these.  And they absolutely LOVE them!  They're moist and chewy, and I've been able to train them both to sit up on their back feet on command for these treats.  I hadn't held out much hope for these since we'd already tried Petromalt and had switched them to expensive hairball formula cat food, but I was definitely surprised at how well they work.

However, neither one of us goes out of our way to get Starbucks because we don't like the taste for some reason. If Starbucks is considered bitter, that is probably why.<br /><br />Review.<br />I would consider this coffee bold yet not bitter. It's definitely full flavored yet not over powering. Maybe that is what ""Crema e Gusto"" is specifying. The ratio of coffee to water for a Dunkin Donuts drinker is about 3/4 of a table spoon to 6oz of water. I accredit the smaller ratio to how finely ground the coffee is rather than overall strength.<br /><br />I drink iced coffee in the summer so even though it is January I had to try it. This coffee is IDEAL for making iced coffee because you can make it at 1.5 table spoons to 6oz of water and the taste is not effected by a little bit of ice melting.

This balance made the tea even more enjoyable---a sort of different kind of teasan, one balanced with a little green tea.<br /><br />Stash Tea has been around for over 35 years, and I love the direction they are moving with their teas, towards more organic and loose teas, more true flavors instead of artificial flavorings.<br /><br />I would highly recommend Stash's Organic Premium Lemon Ginger Green Tea unless you do not care for ginger or for spicier teas; otherwise you are certain to be delighted!<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****"

Because they are dried, he seems to enjoy them less the more he eats them.  With water, the treats may be much more flavorful.  After having a fair amount, he starts to lose interest in them until he can drink.<br /><br />This brings me to a question regarding serving size.  The container recommends 2-3 cubes per day for a medium breed.  The issue I'm having is that the size of the cubes is so very inconsistent.  Some bits are the size of a pea while others of a grape.  The rest are a variety of sizes in between.  Some consistency would be preferred.<br /><br />Also, this product comes highly recommended for training because it is low in fat.  My dog certainly won't learn anything with just 2-3 of these per day.  Like most dogs, he is highly motivated by food so 20-30 treats is more accurate.  To make this possible, I have to dice them up into smaller pieces or shift through to find the little bits.<br /><br />At least these treats are natural and thus healthier than some of the other options.  I just didn't expect to have to prepare them first."

I also consider it to be one of those kind of movies that could have come out only in the 80s (much like Labyrinth starring David Bowie and Jennifer Connelly).<br /><br />Beetlejuice deals with a recently deceased married couple, the Maitlands, who finds themselves essentially ""trapped"" in their former house for the next century or so. Unfortunately, this means living with the house's new owners, the Deetz. The Maitlands don't mind Deetz daughter Lydia played by Winona Ryder so much but her much more obnoxious parents and want to scare them away from the house. Their case worker tells them only one thing: to NEVER even think about recruiting her former assistant Beetlejuice. Unfortunately, they manage to resist for a while before giving in and Beetlejuice causes nothing but problems.<br /><br />It's definitely a work by Tim Burton. His ever-present ""uniqueness"" and charm is there. Beetlejuice is a fun 80s movie and a very fun watch period. the acting by everyone involved in the movie is great (especially Michael Keaton as Beetlejuice). The make-up for the necessary characters were well done and the ""afterlife"" set designs and make-up there were great. I loved the make-up and designs in the afterlife scenes.<br /><br />The movie itself is great and I would have given it five stars. The blu-ray as a whole leaves a little to be desired. It's one of those DVDs or blurays that pretty much leaps right into the movie. No title screen, scene selection, anything. This was a bit annoying since I had to manually go skip through the whole movie to get back to where I left off the night before. There's a small handful of special features that you may or may not be interested in. The special features are only three episodes of the cartoon series (of which I watched as a kid) and an audio track. The special features it does have really aren't that bad, I would have just liked to have had more. Like some sort of commentary, deleted scenes, or something.<br /><br />All in all, five stars for movie itself and three for the blu-ray (averaging four stars)."

Jalapenos, tomatillos and tequila. Very mild, crispy and refreshing. Amazing on tamales. Expect to finish this bottle fast.<br /><br />2) Original Death - delicious, frutty and moderately spicy. If you felt like original Tabasco is not hot enough, this one will be just right. Good with pretty much everything.

Great on red meat, absolutely gorgeous on lamb and pork.  My favorite so far.<br /><br />4) Sudden Death. Did you read the recommendation on the bottle about using a micro-drop? Oh, you didn't... Well, you probably should. This thing is HOT. But it feels interesting: not an instant kick, but rather fast growing powerful avalanche of heat with long earthy aftertaste. It will put tears on your eyes and smile on your face - that's for sure.

I have recently discovered Wellness Core dry food and I have to say that I am impressed with the nutritional content. I have a four month old kitten who had a lot of digestive issues when I first adopted her, however since being on Wellness, I have noticed a vast improvement. I give her half of a 3 oz can of Wellness kitten formula twice daily, and a 1/4 cup of Core twice daily and she has been doing quite well on that diet. My goal is to eventually eliminate dry food from her diet completely (I have done a lot of research on feline nutrition, and I really believe it's not healthy for them), but in the meantime, I am happy that I can feed her a dry food that is grain free and not as full of carbs as most dry cat foods.

All of the rave reviews made me even more eager to try this seemingly great flavor. Unfortunately this coffee fails to deliver. There is hardly any aroma when it brews and the coffee itself on the smallest cup setting looks and tastes like dirty water with a hint of coconut flavor. Since this coffee was the first coffee I ever brewed in my Keurig I thought the machine was faulty. But then I tried out other flavors and it turns out that the coffee itself is to blame. I usually have my coffee with a generous amount of flavored creamer so for ME to think certain coffees are weak means that it is EXTREMELY weak. I even tried the coffee without any creamer or sugar and it was STILL without much flavor. I will NOT be purchasing this coffee EVER again.

It is supposed to calm nerves, and cure anything from the common cold, to cancer.  Or so tradition would have one think.  I dunno....  Chicken soup never did me any harm, I guess -- but I can't remember it curing anything, either.  Though not my favourite soup, I never really disliked it.  OK....<br /><br />My mother makes a clear soup.  Soak the chicken, and vegetables, under a low light, in a covered pot, for hours.  Then, take the fat off with a ladel.  Remove the chicken and vegetables, and serve on a separate platter, (so that just the right amount of chicken stock and vegetables go into each person's soup...or none at all, if desired.)<br />Not bad!<br /><br />My own way of making chicken soup is a little simpler.  Take chicken meat, (breat, dark meat from the legs, whatever you wish), and cut into small pieces, (the smaller, the better.)  Place 1/2 milk, half-water mixture in blender, and slowly add chicken pieces, and mixed vegetables and spices if you wish.  After a few minutes, you have a nicely PUREED chicken soup.  Also not bad.<br /><br />However, CAMPELL'S HEALTHY REQUEST CREAM OF CHICKEN SOUP, which I bought to save refrigerator space, (chicken parts have to be refrigerated, this soup does not) -- doesn't taste good, (OR like either my mom's chicken soup, or my own).  I suppose this is because ""modified food starch"", (the second ingredient in this Campbell's soup), was never used by either my mother or myself in OUR<br />chicken soups.  (Has ANYONE ever added modified food starch to their home-made chicken soups, I wonder?).  Yes, there are tiny bits of chicken meat in this soup, (fourth ingredient, after chicken stock, modeified food starch, and water)...but very little of these.  Most ofthe ingredients come under the heading: Less than 2% of"", but I begin to wonder if the ""chicken meat"" contained in the first section of ingredients, (those above 2%), may be like only 3% or so!  In the ""2% or less"" category are listed both ""salt"" and ""sea salt""....making for perhaps 4% salt, in toto.  This is supposed to be a ""low-sodium"" soup -- but is 410 mgs of salt, (17% of Daily Value), actually a ""low sodium"" soup?  Pehaps, compared to the regular Campbell's soup, (listed at 840 mgs on the label), it is.  But NO-ONE I ever knew puts even 410 mgs of salt into any home-made soup.  A preservative?  Yes.  But still too much salt for my taste.  VITAMIN E is also a preservative -- and a much healthier one at that.  More expensive -- definiely yes.  But it would make the soup far more palatable to have 1/2 the salt, (205 mgs), and then adding a little Vitamin E!  All I know is that this abundance of salt adds not only somewhat of a danger to my heart, but also a slightly sour taste to this soup.  Making it taste, not only sour, but also so very, very UNLIKE the chicken soup I either my mom or I make.<br /><br />Perhaps the regular, Non-Healthy Request Chicken Soup by Campbell's is better.  I'll get one or two cans from my local supermarket and see, before I buy 24 via Amazon, (which is what I should have done, before buying this ""Healthy Request"" Campbell's soup.)  Truly, I like their Heathy Request Mushroom and Celery Soups, and don't find their Healthy Request Tomato Soup half-bad.  But one can't judge every Campbell's soup by the ones that one likes, it seems.  This cicken soup is just too salty and too soury for me ever to buy it again.  But it is palatable...JUST palatable. So, yes, I will force myself to finish all twenty-four 10 and 3/4 ounce cans....maybe one every three days or so.<br />Chicken soup is, after all, supposed to be good for one.  Or so they say.<br /><br />I'm sure this isn't BAD soup.  I just wish it tasted better."

I've heard numerous good things about Wellness from my dog trainer, as well as other pet owners and pet store employees. My dog is adjusting to the new food well. However, I can tell he doesn't consider it the most tasty of choices- probably because it doesn't have the artificial flavoring in it.

Many people are unaware of this because the major television stations are not broadcasting information that would incriminate their owners but just google or YouTube search if you want to know what is happening and what your government is not doing about it.  I definitely recommend boycotting major media and getting your news from alternative sources like ENENews which covers what university professors and doctors say is the real truth.

The forest service recommended bringing at least 32 ounces per person. This bottle of Essentia looked like a good way for us to bring the recommended amount, and yet still have some left over. Needless to say, after climbing over 1000 ft in a mile and a half, we found ourselves glad we had this product. It touts having lots of essential vitamins, etc to help you with such situations. I'm not sure if it really made that big of a difference compared to regular drinking water. It certainly tastes about like regular water, so nothing really bad to say about the taste of the product. In our case, it was water (whether enhanced or not), and it helped us achieve our goal of visiting the cave and having the water we needed. It certainly served its purpose. The question begs, though, would our experience have been any different had we just had regular water? The entrance to the cave even had natural spring water you could fill your containers with.<br /><br />I'm one who certainly gets daily headaches if I do not drink enough water. I've personally found drinking things like Gatorade or Propel certainly help me more than just drinking water. I suspect Essentia is going to be similar, despite its taste being basically water.

We sprayed our furniture with <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EI1BRO"">NaturVet Bitter Yuck No Chew Spray</a> to make it taste bad and redirected his chewing tendencies towards this toy.  As you can see, he loves the toy and although he is NOT a food-motivated dog, it combined with the Bitter Yuck to stop him from destroying property.<br /><br />As per other reviews, the treat is indeed difficult for my hands to stuff into the toy (my fiance did it in the end). Tock has been trying to get the treat out for about a week and not yet succeeded.  The way he manipulates the toy simulates how he would gnaw marrow out of a bone, engaging his paws as well as his jaws.  As an additional benefit, he is also less obsessed with running now, as you can see from the video.  The product does not smell or become sticky.  It is an outstanding product."

The use of menadione over the natural alternatives (such as leafy greens and kelp) is only for cost-saving reasons, hence usually only found in cheaper and lower quality animal food. It's surprising that pet food at this high of a price actually contains this substance.<br /><br />Menadione is banned by the Food & Drug Administration in over-the-counter supplements due to its potential for organ toxicity. It's also banned in Europe for human consumption.<br /><br />A study in rats showed that exposure to menadione ""produced lesions in the kidney, heart, liver and lung."" Chiou et al.

[Prior to that, my well-adjusted cat would eat raw chicken, high quality canned foods, organic kibble--all the ""good stuff""]<br /><br />Both cats thrived on S/D.  So much so that the kitten grew and grew and grew, into a hefty 9 pounds at 7 months. The 4 year-old cat began ignoring her own food and started eating the kitten's food.  She filled out, also, but to a nice adult weight of 6 pounds.<br /><br />Okay, so 2 months later the kitten is up to 10 pounds and can barely walk without panting.  She cannot stop eating this S/D stuff.  She's enormous, way bigger than her 4 year-old housemate.  I decide to switch back to the healthier food--like Innova Evo, which is 88% meat protein and grain free.  I also augment with superior wet food (the 100% organic, human grade stuff, along with raw chicken, etc).<br /><br />Kitten is okay with that switch--like a tiger she tears away at the raw chicken, gulps at the premium can food--but the older cat doesn't like it, although I do it very gradually over 3 months.  I sit with her, pet her, calm her...Yes, she does eat, just not much--a few kibble crunches, or a tablespoon of wet food.  [Cornell has over 300 studies on anorexic cats].<br /><br />A couple months go by and the kitten is looking better, not panting as much (and  2 pounds lighter) but our 4 year-old cat is now down to 2.9 pounds!  All her ribs show and she has bones where her shoulders are.  She looks like a cheetah that's been deprived of food.  No mater what food I put in front of her--dry, wet, kibble, shredded meat--she will only nibble bits and pieces, here and there.  Her fur has lost its glossy coat.<br /><br />The vet tells me I have to do something, anything, to stop the decline in my cat's health, even if it means feeding the crummy Science Diet Kitten food, Original Formula.<br /><br />I am two days into feeding the cat the S/D Kitten food.  She is wolfing this stuff down as if there's no tomorrow.  It makes me sad that she's become another S/D addict--it's that darn corn filler, converts to sugar and cats love it.  I know, I'd rather have her alive and eating this crud, then wasting to nothing away on more nourishing food.  At least I can console myself that the kitten KNOWS she's a feline and eats like one."

The result tasted fine; not the best I'd ever had, but good enough for a sample run.  My second go with the coffee was a bit more involved, but met with better brewing results.  My household had run out of ground coffee, so I cut open several Marley packets to use in our <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002S4DI2S"">Technivorm Moccamaster Coffee Brewer With Thermo Carafe - Technivorm 9587</a>.

There seemed to be more large tender pieces than crunchy, but the dogs loved it all.  The food size was fine for both the large dog and the small dog.  The large dog transitioned from her regular food to Chef's with no trouble.  The smaller dog had some digestive issues for a few days (very soft stools) until that cleared up and she was fine.

Lee ""Dr. Justine Lee""",5,5,5,1259280000,Veterinarian review,"It's not every day that you learn about a great product and solid company that makes you want to quit your job and join them, right? Well, I discovered Zuke's, a ""bone brokering,"" performance pet nutrition company based out of Durango, Colorado that makes treats so good that you almost want to eat them. I was first introduced to a sample size of Zuke's ""Hip Action"" treats, and questioned how ""natural"" they really were. With the melamine-induced pet food scare back in March of last year, I've been much more discriminating (as a vet) in what I feed my pets (as a pet owner!) and always make sure to read the ingredients on any treat or food product.<br /><br />Being that JP, my 10 year-old rescue pit bull, has discriminating tastes (i.e., he's uber-picky and doesn't even eat pig ears sometimes!), I thought I'd put him to the test. Well, he wolfed these Hip Action semi-moist dog treats down and begged for more. JP has always been partial to soft treats, and these often contain a lot of propylene glycol (which is a humectant used to add or preserve moisture content of the treat). Upon reviewing the ingredients in Zuke's treats, I was impressed that I understood all the ingredient names and they were quite natural after all! Keep in mind that ""natural"" is different from ""organic"" (which must be certified organic). ""Natural"" means that no additional ingredients are added into the product, and I was glad to hear that all of Zuke's ingredients are natural by definition of AAFCO. I also loved how all the ingredients are sourced in the USA, as we know we have tighter regulations (USDA, FDA, AAFCO) than other countries (hence, the pet food poisoning last year). Zuke's only exception to this is their lamb and venison, which are imported from New Zealand. Apparently, even the salmon in their treats are wild-caught! (Remember, we green-crunchy types always want to promote that people eat WILD salmon, as farmed salmon has quite a severe, unhealthy effect on the environment).<br /><br />Hip Action: Ahhh... my favorite. Well, actually, JP's favorite. As a 10 year-old dog, JP is fit, lean, and well conditioned... but he still is slowing down from arthritis. I have him on Cosequinn DS (double strength), which contains 500 mg of glucosamine and 400 mg of chondroitin (GAGs) in each capsule. Unfortunately, I have to pill JP each time (by hiding it in a meatball of canned food) to get this medication into him. Zuke's provides a tastier option in these Hip Action treats (dog), which contain 300 mg of glucosamine and 50 mg of chondroitin. These are very similar in size, appearance, and ingredient to the Jerky Natural treats - with the added benefit of these cartilage-protecting, safe products and some blueberries, apples, carrots, and flax seed to boot. That said, keep in mind that most of the veterinary research that has been done has only evaluated Cosequinn (we vets know that this brand of GAGs works), so I can't vouch for the anti-arthritis properties of Hip Action. That said, it's likely the same and is benign enough to be a safe, healthy treat for your dog. For you cat lovers, fear not. Zuke's has this in cat form too. Your average cat likely doesn't need it, but if your cat is diagnosed with arthritis, has had a fracture before, is stiff getting up in the morning, or is grossly overweight, it might be worth trying this treat for Kitty. With only 2 calories per treat, these cat Hip Actions contain 50 mg of glucosamine and 15 mg of chondroitin."

It has beef and beef bone flavorings, perhaps an acquired taste, but they are well executed for an instant product.  It's less piquant than the ""gourmet spicy"" classic flavor, but very rich in taste thanks to the beef bone extract and other seasonings.  If you like nong shim's gourmet spicy, you'll probably like this.  I like pork bone ramen (Tonkotsu) and really like this as it has the same milky richness in the broth.  I am excited that it's relatively lower sodium (920mg per serving=half pack) than most similar products and apparently has no added MSG... with so much flavor they apparently don't MSG or so much salt.<br /><br />*edit- to other folks that prefer gourmet spicy... i agree that is a classic but enjoyed these more: very good broth especially, less heat but more rich flavor than gourmet spicy.  the lack of sumptuous hunks of freeze dried beef doesn't bother me, I'll garnish mine with whatever I have in the fridge.

So when these came, I feasted on them even with the aftertaste - but I actually felt queasy after trying some on two different occasions.  I decided to send them back to Amazon.<br /><br />Instead Amazon customer service overnighted another bag and told me I didn't have to worry about sending back the first one (gotta love Amazon).

I like the idea of all of the vitamins in there, just as I would take a multi-vitamin, but I just wish that their bellies could keep full after eating. I probably won't go back to this kibble.

I have a book my Son's bought me a few Christmas' ago which I'm looking at to get some ideas on this most important phase - how to make this young tree look like a weathered, stately old creature full of wisdom, and full of the care, perspective, and artistry of the Bonsai. This is a great purchase and I'm grateful to my wife for the gift. Now comes the hard part, to look into my deeper self and attempt what I know is far beyond me, to create a work of art I will cherish for years. I highly recommend this product, and would appreciate it if you'd wish me luck as I try to move further on this path."

Since I've been feeding Premium Edge, her coat has gone back to a very shiny black.  I have to conclude that this food has had something to do with that.  I checked it out on a dog food review site, and they give it 4 stars, which is pretty good, on their 6-star system.  (Their 6-star foods are very expensive and I can't afford them.  I also don't think my house pets need them) Their major qualm was that there was no statement about whether the fish in the food contained ethoxyquin, which is apparently a bad thing.

Now that they are the same size, we can't keep them from stealing each other's food, so we needed something they could both eat.  We tried a couple of holistic all-stages foods, and this one has been the best, by far.  Both cats prefer the little ""T"" shape kibble over round kibble, they seem to enjoy the taste, and it keeps them and their digestive systems happy ... and that keeps ME happy.  ;-)  My older cat does better on a grain-free food, and has gotten a case of the itchies on this food, but it is not nearly as bad as with most grain-inclusive foods we've tried.

There is no sugar, baking powder, baking soda, egg, guar or xanthan gum (nothing to hold the finished product together for those of you who are new to Gluten Free Baking). Items you try to make with this mix as is will fall apart and taste bad. In other words, this is a mix you HAVE to experiment with in order to make things come out looking or tasting good at all. Most of us who have to eat Gluten Free foods are looking for shortcuts like every other busy person on the planet. This mix will add to your busy time, not relieve you.

The seaweed in this soup has a nice texture, it's not rubbery or anything like that. Just pleasant. The smell might remind you of the sea, but I don't think that's a big surprise.

I cook with olive oil or use it as dressing or add few spoons into my dish since I need the good unsaturated fat contained in olives in in my diet.

I use much more expensive EXTRA VIRGIN olive oils which taste very fruity and sharp from EU but I have been to their farms and know the product real well and trust the producer as well. Unfortunately, olive oil being the gold standard of the cooking oil is produced and mixed with other oils and adulterated by many for financial gain but not this one since it is pure olive oil. Only EXTRA VIRGIN, the first round of olives that have been pressed have the 200 antioxidants, not refined or mixed with other oils.

To me, it now tasted like chemicals.<br /><br />I went to look at the box to see that it said, ""Lower Sugar"". Now I had found a clue, but I couldn't really blame my wife because I don't really need the oatmeal to be super sweet. I'm fine with less sugar, although that wasn't my issue.

I wish I was one of them.<br /><br />I also wish that Quaker would have mentioned the artificial sweetener clearly on the front of the box.<br /><br />Be warned.

So an Amazon Vine offer of these chips seemed a sure bet.<br /><br />They taste a bit like sweet potatoes, yet ever so slightly sweeter --- with fewer calories and half the fat of a bag of real sweet potato chips (100 calories, 30% from fat, compared to 130 calories with half from fat in a regular bag of chips).<br /><br />But I agree with others. The taste is slightly strange --- and the ingredients tell why. The key ingredient isn't sweet potato, but RICE FLOUR! Sweet potato flakes (whatever those are) come second, then tapioca starch. Next comes oil (sunflower, safflower, or canola) then yellow corn flour. And finally there's cane syrup --- sugar --- which explains why the chips seem a tad sweeter than sweet potatoes.<br /><br />I like these Sweet Potato Popchips well enough, and will keep the box at the ready for brown bag lunches over the next several weeks.<br /><br />I may buy them again, too --- but only if no real sweet potato chips are available to satisfy my sweet potato tooth."

I have searched and searched for a very tiny kibble which, when water is added, will not take an hour to soften up for them.  All others I have tried are so hard  and larger than I like, except bil-jac.  I have been giving them bil-jac for years mixed with canned dog food.  Bil-jac is the only one I had found that the kibbles are small and easy to crumble for them even dry.  To add water to it, however, makes it more gooey.  I wanted to try something new for them but had just about given up.  I tried this brand of canned dog food and that was a hit so thought I'd give this dry a try.  Well, it works just great and they love it.  I use a  Cuisinart  k-cup type coffee maker that also is used in our household for hot water.  I just put the dog food in a bowl add the hot water and it is soft enough in less than 10 minutes.  It is not as gooey as bil jac when wet. The kibble is triangle shaped about 3/8 of an inch on all sides. VERY TINY, which is what I needed. I would recommend this food to anyone with small dogs, older dogs of any size who have gum and teeth problems and have  trouble chewing or are missing teeth and can't chew at all. I am so happy I discovered this food!  P.S.  It's a very healthy food for them too.

Do people not read the Nutrition Facts on the back of the box anymore?<br /><br />The Gorilla Crunch ingredients are:  Organic corn meal, organic evaporated cane juice, sea salt.<br /><br />Add some bananas, strawberries and blueberries to this cereal, and you've got yourself the most wholesome, nutritious, healthy and delicious breakfast on planet Earth!  :)<br /><br />Decide for yourselves people, but do your due diligence and your homework.  Ignorance is NOT bliss!  :) This is a wonderful and gunk free cereal.  Do you not all wonder why cancer is so rampant now days?  Do all the chemicals and preservatives and hormones (in meats and dairy) and things we can't even pronounce not play their part in it?  Think again...."

I am a huge fan of Lindt (Switzerland), Lacta (Greece), Milka (Switzerland), Perugina (Italy), and many other premium and even expensive brands.  Despite these, I am a huge fan of Hershey's milk chocolate, because of it's unique, signature taste.  Also, Hershey's has not apparently changed or 'watered down' their formula like Nestle's has.  In fact, many chocolate companies have changed to cheaper ingredients to cut costs, such as Nestle's.  Hershey's has seemingly always stuck to their original formula, and it truly rivals the best the world has to offer because of it's unique flavor.  Long live Hershey's milk chocolate!  It rivals some of the world's best!"

The only exception is that I give them the Happy Bellies oatmeal as well as their rice and multigrain. These have extra iron formulated to be easily absorbed and also the probiotics which are probably part of the reason both babies are nice and regular. They're organic and whole grain so they're healthy and train the babies taste to like whole grain. I mix it with water and they gobble it up and love it.

This tastes great when it's accompanying any hot blueberry breakfast- pancakes or waffles with blueberries would be nice served with this coffee, too. It's definitely a milder coffee, but it still tastes like coffee. I drink it w/ a couple teaspoons of raw sugar & a couple teaspoons of Coffeemate, and enjoy it even served alone. Not my everyday coffee, but since I love blueberry muffins, it's one I like to keep on hand. If you like flavored coffee, coffee in general & blueberries, I think you'd enjoy this."

It is definitely packed with nutrients and is a great source of many vitamins and minerals.  It's flavor is good, although this is the first nutritional yeast I've bought, so I can't compare it to other brands.  The smell upon first opening the jar seemed a bit strong, but it wasn't as bad after using it and opening/closing the jar a few times.<br /><br />I am mostly writing this review to let other potential customers know that this product is NOT VEGAN.  I guess everyone defines veganism a little differently, but this nutritional yeast contains whey from milk, so if you don't want to eat dairy, or can't for some health reason, you should be aware of that before you purchase it.  I will quote the ingredients list from another website:<br /><br />""Other Ingredients: Nutritional yeast, calcium carbonate, whey (from milk), magnesium carbonate, potassium phosphate monobasic, choline bitartrate, niacinamide, potassium chloride, d-calcium pantothenate, para aminobenzoic acid, bromelain, GTF chromium yeast, inositol, cyanocobalamin, ferrous sulfate, selenium yeast, papain, pyridoxine hydrochloride, thiamin mononitrate, riboflavin, sodium chloride, zinc sulfate, manganese sulfate, biotin, folic aicd, potassium iodide.""<br /><br />This is the same as what is on my jars' labels.  You can get the entire nutritional facts and ingredients from the Twinlab website [...]  It's a nice product at a reasonable price in a large quantity.  In fact, it's going to take me a while to go through two pounds of it (how much yeast can a guy eat?).  When I finally do finish it, I won't be ordering again due to the dairy, but if that doesn't bother you, I would actually recommend this product as it seems to be a good deal.  I gave it four stars because the dairy thing was really my fault.  I should have done some more research of my own.<br /><br />Happy shopping."
